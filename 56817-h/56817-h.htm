<p class="center"><b>Transcriber’s Note</b></p>

<p>This e-text uses a lot of uncommon Unicode characters, for example ℔
(U+2114 L B BAR SYMBOL), ꝥ (U+A765 LATIN SMALL LETTER THORN WITH STROKE),
♈ (U+2648 ARIES). If these (and others) don’t display for you, you may
need to install additional fonts on your device. In particular, a
Fraktur/‘black letter’ font (such as Old English Text MT) is recommended
for the parts of the book dealing with German typography.</p>

<p>Page numbering replicates that in the original: pp. i-xiv
in Roman, followed by page 9 sqq. in Arabic numerals. No pages are
missing or duplicated.</p>

<p>Further notes appear <a href="#transnote">at the end</a>.</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION.</h2>

<hr class="r15" />

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Usefulness</span> rather than originality has been
aimed at in the preparation of the <span class="smcap">American
Printer</span>, which is offered as an improvement on the
typographical work formerly published by us. In addition
to the results of actual personal experience embodied
in the volume, information has been gathered
and extracts have been freely made from various
publications, such as <cite>Ames and Dibdin’s Typographical
Antiquities</cite>, <cite>Thomas’s History of Printing</cite>, <cite>Timperley’s
Dictionary of Printers and Printing</cite>, <cite>Savage’s Dictionary
of Printing</cite>, <cite>Johnson’s Typographia</cite>, <cite>Chambers’s
Encyclopædia</cite>, <cite>Beadnell’s Guide to Typography</cite>, as well
as other books referred to in the notes. The work has
been prepared amid the manifold interruptions incident
to business life; yet we think nothing has been overlooked
that is essential for the instruction of the learner
or for the assistance of the workman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides the matter relating to practical typography,
the volume contains a sketch of the discovery of printing,
and notices of type-founding, stereotyping, electrotyping,
and lithography. The implements employed in typography
are described and their uses explained; and
complete schemes for imposition are laid down. The
valuable tables and the plans of cases for various languages,
and for music and labour-saving rule, will be
found extremely useful; as well as the extensive lists
of abbreviations and of foreign words and phrases, and
orthographical hints.</p>

<p>Special attention has been given in setting forth the
functions and duties of the foreman and proof-reader,
so that the operations of an office may be prosecuted
with efficiency, comfort, and economy.</p>

<p>Authors and publishers, as well as young printers,
may consult the volume with profit; and, indeed, any
intelligent person will find it serviceable.</p>

<p><i>At the very epoch when the greatness of Burgundy was most swiftly ripening,
another weapon was secretly forging, more potent in the great struggle for
freedom than any which the wit or hand of man has ever devised or wielded.
When Philip the Good, in the full blaze of his power, and flushed with the
triumphs of territorial aggrandizement, was instituting at Bruges the order of
the Golden Fleece, “to the glory of God, of the blessed Virgin, and of the holy
Andrew, patron saint of the Burgundian family,” and enrolling the names of
the kings and princes who were to be honoured with its symbols, at that very
moment, an obscure citizen of Haarlem, one Lorenz Coster, or Lawrence the
Sexton, succeeded in printing a little grammar, by means of movable types. The
invention of printing was accomplished, but it was not ushered in with such a
blaze of glory as heralded the contemporaneous erection of the Golden Fleece.
The humble setter of types did not deem emperors and princes alone worthy his
companionship. His invention sent no thrill of admiration throughout Christendom;
and yet, what was the good Philip of Burgundy, with his Knights of the
Golden Fleece, and all their effulgent trumpery, in the eye of humanity and
civilization, compared with the poor sexton and his wooden type?</i></p>

<h3>DISCOVERY OF PRINTING.</h3>

<div>
<img src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="" class="dropcap" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap-i"><span class="word1">The</span> credit of inventing the art which perpetuates
the history and achievements of
all the arts and sciences has been obstinately
contested, several cities having advanced
rival claims to the honour of the
discovery. This, however, should be no
matter of surprise when we consider that
the inventor of a new art, unprotected by
law, would naturally endeavour to conceal its processes for his
own use and advantage. After due consideration, we agree
with Isaiah Thomas in the opinion that the probabilities point
to <span class="smcap">Laurentius</span> (sometimes called Coster, Koster, and Kustos)
as the discoverer of the art of printing.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Laurentius lived at Haarlem and was a man of property.
He seems to have been engaged in printing books from wood
blocks or plates, well known to antiquaries as the <cite>Block Books</cite>,
in which the reading matter was illustrated by rude pictures.
Fragments of works so printed by him are still in existence.
Among others, the celebrated <cite>Biblia Pauperum</cite>, executed between
1410 and 1420, has been attributed to him. It was only
natural that his thoughts should be led to the production of
single types, as a means of cheapening and facilitating his
work. These were first made of wood, and afterward of tin.
The date of his invention of separate types is given as about
the year 1429. Other dates have been stated, ranging from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
1422 to 1436. The first of his printed books, it is claimed,
was the <cite>Speculum Humanæ Salvationis</cite>, of which about ten
copies are now known to be in existence. A small primer, or
<cite>Abecedarium</cite>, in our opinion, shows all the marks of the first
attempt of an experimenter in a new art. Koster died in 1439.</p>

<p>The necessity for employing workmen to assist in prosecuting
the art led to the divulging of the secret. Among these
men, it is supposed, was John Geinsfleisch, (or Gutenberg,
Senior,) who, after learning the processes, returned to Mentz,
his native place, and communicated the secret to his nephew,
John Gutenberg, an ingenious artist of Strasburg. It is in
evidence that the latter, in connection with two partners, spent
a considerable amount of money in some private experiments.
These appear to have occupied several years, from 1436 to
1439, when a legal contest arose as to the rights of one of the
partners whose zealous activity had caused his death. Gutenberg
continued at Strasburg till 1444, when, his means being
exhausted, he rejoined his uncle at Mentz. Here he renewed
his experiments, and, needing money, he procured an introduction
to John Fust, a capitalist and money-lender, who
seems to have been struck with the importance of the work,
and who advanced a considerable amount (all the tools and
presses being pledged as security) in furtherance of the enterprise.
Two years were occupied in making the types and
necessary machinery, when the great work of printing the
Bible was begun. There can be little doubt that, during all
his years of experiment, Gutenberg had executed smaller
books, one of which is surmised to have been a reproduction
of the Dutch <cite>Speculum</cite> of Koster. The <cite>Donatus</cite> of 1451, the
<cite>Appeal against the Turks</cite> of 1454, and the <cite>Letters of Indulgence</cite>
of 1454 and 1455, all appeared before the Bible,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
was not published till 1455 or 1456. This great book marked
an era in the art.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>It is painful to be told that about this time Fust foreclosed
the mortgage, and the entire work with all the materials
passed into his possession. It seems, however, that Gutenberg
succeeded in re-establishing a press, and continued to
practise the art, but produced no work at all comparable with
the Bible. He died about 1468.</p>

<p>After securing possession of the establishment, Fust engaged
the service of Peter Schœffer, who had been apprentice
or assistant to Gutenberg, and who was distinguished for
scholarship as well as mechanical skill. His skill and the
improvements made by him in the art soon led Fust to take
him into partnership, and the Bible, the Psalter, and other
important works were produced. Schœffer was further rewarded
by the hand of the grand-daughter of Fust.</p>

<p>From this rapid summary, we may conclude, 1. That the
merit of the invention of printing, however rude it may have
been, belongs to Koster of Haarlem; 2. That Gutenberg placed
the art on a permanent foundation; and, 3. That its economical
application was insured by Peter Schœffer’s invention
of cast metal types.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>It was of course impossible to conceal the knowledge of
an art so useful to man, and within ten years after the publication
of the great Bible presses were established in several
German cities, in Rome and other parts of Italy, and soon
thereafter in France and England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>William Caxton acquired a knowledge of the art in Germany,
and carried it into practice at Westminster in England.
The year 1477 is now accepted as the date of the introduction,
the first book printed with a date in England being the <cite>Dictes
and Sayinges of the Philosophers, emprynted by me, William
Caxton, at Westmestre, the yere of our Lord m.cccc.l.xxvij.</cite>
He had previously printed, without a date, <cite>The Recuyell of
the Historyes of Troye</cite>, which was followed by <cite>The Game and
Playe of the Chesse, fynysshid the last day of marche the yer
of our lord god. a. thousand foure honderd and lxxiiii.</cite> These
were, however, printed at Bruges; so, according to Mr. William
Blades, “the first indisputable date we have to stand on is the
printing of <cite>The Dictes</cite> in 1477.”</p>

<p>Though at that time over sixty years old, Caxton was notable
for his industrious habit. He was possessed of good
sense and sound judgment; steady, persevering, active, zealous,
and liberal in his devices for that important art which he
introduced into England, labouring not only as a printer, but
as translator and author. The productions of his press amount
to sixty-four. In the churchwardens’ books of St. Margaret’s
Parish, Westminster, his death is thus recorded: “1491. Item,
atte bureyng of William Caxton, for iiii. torches vj<i>s.</i> viij<i>d.</i>
Item, for the belle atte same bureyng, vj<i>d.</i>”</p>

<p>The Bible was printed in Spanish at Valencia in 1479 by
Lambert Palmaert, a German; but so completely was it afterward
suppressed by the Inquisition that only four leaves now
remain in the archives of Valencia. The first Hebrew Bible
ever printed came from the press of Abraham Colorito, at
Soncino, in 1488—a very remarkable work. Iceland had its
printing-office in 1530, at which a Bible was printed in 1584.</p>

<h3>ANCIENT PECULIARITIES.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">The</span> pages were either large or small folios, but sometimes
quartos, and, the early books were therefore cumbrous
and unhandy. Aldus Manuccio, of Venice, was the first to
introduce the octavo form.</p>

<p>The leaves were without running titles, direction-words,
paginal numbers, or divisions into paragraphs.</p>

<p>The character itself was a rude old Gothic (similar to that
now known as <i>Old English</i> or <i>Black</i>) mixed with Secretary,
designed to imitate the handwriting of the times; the words
were printed so close to one another that the matter was
not easily read.</p>

<p>To avoid divisions, the early printers used vowels with a
mark of abbreviation over them to denote that one or more
letters were omitted in the word: <i>e.g.</i> co̅pose for compose,
co̅pletio̅ for completion, &amp;c. No punctuation-marks were used,
except the colon and full point; but an oblique stroke (/) was
after a while introduced, for which the comma was finally
substituted. Logotypes were frequently employed.</p>

<p>Orthography was various and arbitrary. Proper names and
sentences were often begun with small letters, as well as the
first words in lines of poetry.</p>

<p>Blanks were left for the places of titles, initial letters, and
other ornaments, to be supplied afterward by illuminators,
whose calling did not long survive the masterly improvements
made by the printers in this branch of their art. These ornaments
were exquisitely fine, and curiously variegated with
the most beautiful colours, and even with gold and silver.
The margins, likewise, were frequently charged with a variety
of figures, of saints, birds, beasts, monsters, flowers, &amp;c.,
which sometimes had relation to the contents of the page,
though frequently none at all. These embellishments were
often very costly.</p>

<p>The name of the printer, place of his residence, &amp;c. were
either omitted or put at the end of the book, with some pious
ejaculation or doxology.</p>

<p>The date was also omitted, or involved in some cramped
design, or printed either at full length or in numerical letters,
and sometimes partly one and partly the other: thus, One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Thousand CCCC and lxxiiii; but always placed at the end
of the book.</p>

<p>There was no variety of character, nor intermixture of Roman
and Italic, which were later inventions; but the pages
were printed in a Gothic letter of the same size throughout.
Catch-words at the end of the foot-line (now generally
abolished) were first used at Venice, by Vindeline de Spire.
The inventor of signatures is said to have been Antonio
Zarotti of Milan, about 1470.</p>

<p>Books were often encased in massive coverings, which
were ornamented with florid and arabesque designs. Jewels
and precious metals, the finest stuffs, and the most gorgeous
colours were sometimes employed. Scaliger says, that his
grandmother had a printed Psalter, the cover of which was two
inches thick. On the inner side was a receptacle, containing
a small silver crucifix, with the name of <i>Berenica Codronia
de la Scala</i> behind it.</p>

<p>Two or three hundred copies of a work were considered to
be a large edition.</p>

<h3>PRINTING IN AMERICA.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Printing</span> was introduced into America at Mexico by the
Viceroy Mendoza in 1536. The first book printed was the
<cite>Escala espiritual de San Juan Climaco</cite>, of which no copy is
known to exist; but the oldest American book now extant is
the <cite>Manual de Adultos</cite>, dated 1540, of which only the last four
leaves are to be found in the library of the Cathedral of Toledo.
The name of the earliest printer is a matter of question.</p>

<p>Cambridge, Massachusetts, is entitled to the distinction of
having the first printing-press in North America, which was
under the charge of Stephen Daye. For this press the colony
was mainly indebted to the Rev. Jesse Glover, a nonconformist
minister possessed of a considerable estate, who had
left England to settle among his friends in Massachusetts.
Some gentlemen of Amsterdam also “gave towards furnishing
of a printing-press with letters, forty-nine pounds and
something more.” This was about 1638. The first book
issued was the <cite>Bay Psalm-Book</cite>, in 1640.</p>

<p>The first book issued in the Middle Colonies was an Almanac,
printed by William Bradford in 1685, near Philadelphia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Bradford was brought out from England in 1684 by William
Penn. As the government of Pennsylvania became very
restrictive in regard to the press, Bradford in 1693 removed
to New York, and was appointed printer to that colony, where
he established in 1725 the <cite>New York Gazette</cite>, the first newspaper
published there. He died May 23, 1752, after an active
and useful life of eighty-nine years.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The first newspaper in America was the <cite>Boston News Letter</cite>,
which was first issued by John Campbell on Monday, April
24, 1704: it was regularly published for nearly seventy-two
years. The second was the <cite>Boston Gazette</cite>, begun December
21, 1719. The third was the <cite>American Weekly Mercury</cite>, issued
in Philadelphia, by Andrew Bradford, on December 22, 1719.
James Franklin, an elder brother of Benjamin, established the
<cite>New England Courant</cite>, August 17, 1721.</p>

<p>The oldest living paper of the United States is the <cite>New
Hampshire Gazette</cite>, published at Portsmouth, now (Oct. 7,
1892) one hundred and thirty-six years old.</p>

<p><cite>The North American and United States Gazette</cite> leads the
existing daily press of this country in point of antiquity.
It is the successor of the <cite>Pennsylvania Packet</cite>, (begun in 1771
and becoming a daily paper in 1784,) and is still the chief
commercial journal of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>The first paper-mill in America was established near Germantown,
Pa., in 1690, by William Rittenhouse.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<h3>TYPE-FOUNDING IN EUROPE.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">For</span> a long period after the discovery of printing, it seems
that type-founding, printing, and binding went under the
general term of <em>printing</em>, and that printers cast the types used
by them, and printed and bound the works executed in their
establishments. Type-founding became a distinct calling early
in the seventeenth century. A decree of the Star Chamber,
made July 11, 1637, ordained the following regulations concerning
English founders:—</p>

<p>“That there shall be four founders of letters for printing,
and no more.</p>

<p>“That the Archbishop of Canterbury, or the Bishop of London,
with six other high commissioners, shall supply the places
of those four as they shall become void.</p>

<p>“That no master-founder shall keep above two apprentices
at one time.</p>

<p>“That all journeyman-founders be employed by the masters
of the trade, and that idle journeymen be compelled to
work, upon pain of imprisonment and such other punishment
as the court shall think fit.</p>

<p>“That no master-founder of letters shall employ any other
person in any work belonging to the casting or founding of
letters than freemen or apprentices to the trade, save only in
pulling off the knots of metal hanging at the end of the letters
when they are first cast; in which work every master-founder
may employ one boy only, not bound to the trade.”</p>

<p>By the same decree, the number of master-printers in England
was limited to twenty.</p>

<p>Regulations like the above were in force till 1693. The
“polyglot founders,” as they have been called, were succeeded
by Joseph Moxon and others. But the English were
unable to compete with the superior productions of the Dutch
founders, until the advent of William Caslon, who, by the
beauty and excellence of his type, surpassed his Batavian
competitors, when the importation of foreign type ceased,
and his founts were, in turn, exported to the Continent.</p>

<p>By an act subsequently passed, no founder was to cast any
letter for printing, no joiner to make any press, no smith to
forge any iron-work for a press; no person to bring from parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
beyond the seas any letters founded or cast for printing; nor
any person to buy any letters or any other materials belonging
unto printing; without application to the master and wardens
of the Company of Stationers.</p>

<h3>TYPE-FOUNDING IN AMERICA.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">A foundry</span>, principally for German type, was established
at Germantown, Pennsylvania, about the year 1735, by
Christopher Saur, (or Sower,) a printer, who executed in German
the first quarto Bible printed in America, as well as other
valuable works in the German language. Three editions of
the Bible were printed—viz., in the years 1743, 1763, and 1776,
the latter two by his son. In 1739, Saur published a newspaper
in Germantown.</p>

<p>An abortive attempt was made about 1768 to set up a
foundry at Boston by a Mr. Mitchelson from Scotland, and
another in Connecticut in 1769 by Abel Buel. In 1775, Dr.
Franklin brought from Europe to Philadelphia the materials
for a foundry; but little use of them was made.</p>

<p>John Baine, a type-founder of Edinburgh, sent a relative to
this country with tools for a foundry at the close of the Revolutionary
War, and soon after came over himself. They carried
on the business till 1790, when Mr. Baine died, and his kinsman
returned to Scotland.</p>

<p>A Dutch founder, Adam G. Mappa, settled at New York
about 1787, and cast Dutch and German faces, as well as
Roman styles and several Oriental alphabets. Want of capital
prevented his success, and many of his matrices passed into
the possession of Binny &amp; Ronaldson.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>In 1796, type-founding was commenced in Philadelphia by
Archibald Binny and James Ronaldson, natives of the city
of Edinburgh, where Binny had carried on the same business.
Their assortment was not extensive, but it embraced the
essential founts,—Brevier, Bourgeois, Long Primer, Small Pica,
Pica, and two-line letters. They were obliging and attentive,
and in twenty years made a fortune. They improved their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
foundry according to the increase of printing and the consequent
demands of the trade, extending their assortment from
Pearl, of 180 lines in a foot, to 12-line Pica, having 6 lines.
Binny made an important improvement in the type-mould, by
which a caster could cast 6000 letters in a day with as much
ease as he before could cast 4000.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>According to Holmes’s <cite>American Annals</cite>, about 200 newspapers
were printed in the United States in the year 1801,
of which 17 were issued daily, 7 three times a week, 30 twice
a week, and 146 weekly. There must also have been at the
same time as many as 60 offices engaged in miscellaneous
printing. The whole business had increased threefold in
eleven years. Another type-foundry was put in successful
operation in Baltimore, about 1805, by Samuel Sower &amp; Co.
It had in it some moulds and matrices which had been used by
Christopher Sower, who had printed in Germantown, near
Philadelphia, and cast his own types. He printed with German
characters; but now the foundry was revived with excellent
Roman and Italic letters, and among other extraordinary things
it had the size called Diamond, with a smaller face than had
ever been cast before. It was the smallest type in the world.</p>

<p>The demand for type was very brisk till the war of 1812
commenced, and the foundries were generally three or four
months in arrears in their execution of orders.</p>

<p>The names of the newspapers published in the United
States in April, 1810, are given in Thomas’s <cite>History of Printing</cite>,
and amount to 359, of which 27 were daily papers, 38<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
were printed twice, 15 three times, and 279 once in a week.
Add those required for general printing, and the whole number
of offices could not be less than 500,—being an increase of
240 in nine years, and some of them using several thousand
pounds of type for book-printing.</p>

<p>In 1811, Elihu White established a type-foundry in New
York. He had been long engaged, in connection with Mr.
Wing, in the manufacture of printing types at Hartford, Connecticut,
upon a plan of their own invention, by which twenty
or thirty letters were cast at once; but, abandoning that
invention, he adopted the old plan of casting, and, having a
good assortment of faces and bodies, his removal to New
York was a great convenience to its printers, and they gave
him a very satisfactory support. But the principal business
in type-founding still continued, as formerly, to be carried on
in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>In 1813, another type-foundry was begun in the city of New
York, by D. &amp; G. Bruce, principally to cast types for their own
use. They had carried on book-printing for seven years, and
had now become acquainted with the stereotype art,—Mr.
David Bruce having visited England in 1812 and acquired it by
purchase and actual labour. For ordinary printing, it was customary
to bevel off the body of the type at the face end, or
shoulder, as it is usually called, which unfitted it for making a
strong stereotype plate in the most approved way: hence the
necessity for casting type expressly for stereotype. Their first
fount was Bourgeois, with which they cast two sets of plates
of the New Testament, (the Common School Testament,) and
sold one of these to Mathew Carey, of Philadelphia, retaining
the other for their own business. But these were not completed
till 1814. In 1815, they cast the plates of the 12mo
School Bible, on Nonpareil type, prepared, like the Bourgeois,
at their own foundry expressly for stereotyping. They thus
gave the first stereotype School Testament and School Bible
to America; but not the first stereotype book. John Watts,
of England, also commenced stereotyping in New York in
1813, and completed the Westminster Catechism that year, a
volume of 120 pages 12mo. David Bruce invented the planing-machine
for equalizing the thickness of stereotype plates,
which is now used in every stereotype foundry in the United
States. The process of stereotyping is, however, entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
different from that of ordinary type-founding, and it is, therefore,
generally carried on as a separate business, or connected
with the composing department of a printing-office. Twenty
compositors and two proof-readers will furnish full employment
for one moulder, one caster, and three finishers, who
will, among them, complete, on an average, 50 pages of octavo
per day.</p>

<p>In 1818, or soon after, a type and stereotype foundry was
established in Boston, and another in Cincinnati, principally
through the enterprise of the late Elihu White, who, having the
means of multiplying matrices with facility, took this method
for the extension of his business. Others followed his example,
and type-foundries were established in Albany, Buffalo, Pittsburgh,
Louisville, and St. Louis, with several additional in
New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. The business,
in fact, was overdone, and failures and suppressions took
place, as competition reduced the prices of types.</p>

<p>The mode of type-founding has within forty years undergone
important changes, which must no doubt be considered
improvements. First among them is the introduction of
machine-casting, in which a pump forces the fluid metal into
the mould and matrix, and gives a sharper outline to the letter
than was formerly given by the most violent throw of the
caster. The old practice of casting a single type only at a
time remains. The first idea of this machine originated with
William M. Johnson, who obtained a patent for it in 1828.
Elihu White put it into use in his type-foundry, and persevered
in using and trying to improve it as long as he lived;
but he did not succeed in removing the greatest fault, which
was a hollowness in the body of the types cast by it, that inclined
them to sink under the pressure of the printing-press.
The first successful type-casting machine was invented by
David Bruce, Jr., of New York, and was patented March 17,
1838. The patent was sold to George Bruce, and the machines
were used by him until 1845. David Bruce meanwhile
patented another machine in 1843, which, with new improvements,
patented two years later, gave entire satisfaction, and
is now in general use in American foundries. By Bruce’s
machine, three times the quantity of type that was cast by
Binny &amp; Ronaldson’s improved mould is now cast in a given
time, and nearly five times the quantity that was cast by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
common hand-mould eighty years ago. This improvement
has passed into Europe, and been adopted by most of the
German type-founders; but in Great Britain for some time it
found little favour. A so-called “automatic machine,” for
casting and finishing type, invented by Johnson &amp; Atkinson,
is in operation in London; but its rate of production seems
to be less than that of the American machine, while, from its
multiform operations, the proportion of imperfect type turned
out must of necessity be considerably more.</p>

<p>The protection now afforded by the patent laws having
checked the piratical production of matrices by electrotyping,
(except in plain faces, a practice still pursued by unprincipled
type-founders,) the leading founders in this country have
been encouraged to produce types of new styles which in
beauty and ingenuity surpass those of foreign origin.</p>

<p>There are now three type-foundries in Boston, seven in New
York, one in Buffalo, four in Philadelphia, four in Baltimore,
two in Cincinnati, four in Chicago, two in Milwaukee, two in
St. Louis, one in Richmond, one in St. Paul, one in Cleveland,
one in Kansas City, and three in California—in all, thirty-six.
Some of these foundries not only supply the printers of the
United States, but most of the printers in Canada, some in the
British West India Islands, Mexico, South America, China,
India and Australasia. American type, in quality, style, and
finish, is equal, if not superior, to any made in Europe.</p>

<p>The following are the prices at which plain types have
been sold for the last seventy-five years, given at ten different
dates, and naming only the principal and most useful sizes:—</p>

<h3>STEREOTYPING.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Stereotyping</span> is said to have been invented by J. Van
der Mey, in Holland, about 1698. A quarto Bible and some
other books were printed by him from plates, which were
formed by soldering the bottoms of common type together.
William Ged, of Edinburgh, discovered the present mode in
1725, and stereotyped parts of the Bible and Prayer-Book.
He encountered malicious opposition, and the business was
abandoned, the new method dying with the inventor. About
1745, Benjamin Mecom, a nephew of Dr. Franklin, cast plates
for a number of the pages of the New Testament. Dr. Alexander
Tilloch, of Glasgow, re-discovered the art in 1781. Stereotyping
gradually spread, and soon effected a considerable
reduction in the cost of books. The arguments that were
advanced against its utility have a ridiculous look at the
present day, when almost every important work is stereotyped
or electrotyped.</p>

<p>Matter for stereotyping is set with high spaces and quadrates.
The forms must be small, containing about two pages
of common octavo. A slug type-high is put above the top line
and another below the foot line of each page, to protect the
ends of the plates from injury when they are passed through
the shaving-machine. Beveled slugs, in height equal to the
shoulder of the type, are placed on both sides and between
the pages, to form the flange by which the plate is to be clasped
by the hooks of the printing-block.</p>

<p>Before the form is sent into the foundry, the type must be
carefully compared with the proof, to detect any errors which
may have been left uncorrected. Care must be taken to lock
up the form perfectly square and quite tight, to prevent the
types from being pulled out when the mould is raised from
the pages. It must be evenly planed down, and no ink or
dirt or incrustations from the ley be allowed to remain on the
surface.</p>

<p>The face of the type being clean and dry, and the bottoms
free from particles of dirt, the form is laid on a clean moulding-stone,
and brushed over with sweet-oil, which must be
laid on as thinly as possible, care being taken that the entire
surface of the types is covered. A moulding-frame, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
screw at each corner, (called a <em>flask</em>,) and fitting neatly to the
form, is next placed around it.</p>

<p>The material for moulding is finely ground gypsum, nine
parts of which are mixed with about seven parts of water, and
well stirred up. A small quantity of the liquid mixture is
poured over the pages, and gently pressed into the counter
of the types with a small roller, for the purpose of expelling
confined air; after which, the remainder of the gypsum is
poured in, until the mould is somewhat higher than the upper
edge of the flask. In a few minutes the mixture sets, and
the upper side is smoothed over with a steel straight-edge.
In about ten minutes the mould is gently raised by means of
the screws at the corners of the flask; and, after being nicely
trimmed at the sides, and nicked on the surface-edges to
make openings for the metal to run in, it is placed on a shelf
in an oven, and allowed to remain until the moisture has
quite evaporated.</p>

<p>The casting-pans may be large enough to hold three or four
moulds. The dried moulds are placed in a pan face downward,
upon a movable iron plate called a floater. The cover
of the casting-pan, which has a hole at each corner for the
passage of the metal, is then clamped to it, and lifted by a
movable crane and gently lowered into the metal-pot,—containing,
it may be, a thousand pounds of liquid metal,—till the
metal begins to flow slowly in at the corners. When the pan
is filled, it is sunk to the bottom of the pot. The metal should
be hot enough to light a piece of brown paper held in it.
After being immersed eight or ten minutes, the pan is steadily
drawn out by means of the crane, and swung over to the cooling-trough,
into which it is lowered and placed upon a stone
so as just to touch the water, in order that the metal at the
bottom of the pan may cool first. The metal contracts while
cooling, and the caster occasionally pours in a small quantity
at the corners from a ladle, till it will take no more. It may
be here remarked that some stereotypers do not dry the
moulds, but immerse them in a green condition into the metal.</p>

<p>The plates are carefully removed from the solid mass
which comes out of the pan, and the plaster is washed from
the surface. If, after examination, the face is good and
sharply set, the plates are passed over to a picker, who removes
any slight defects arising from an imperfection of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
mould. They are then trimmed and passed through the shaving-machine,
till all are brought to an equal thickness. The
flanges are neatly side-planed, and the plates are then boxed,
ready for the printing-press.</p>

<p>In England, the plates are merely turned on the back, and
consequently vary in thickness. This must be a source of continual
expense and annoyance to the pressman. The flanges,
besides, are very imperfectly made,—so imperfectly that they
cannot be used on American printing-blocks; and English
plates, when imported into this country, are therefore sent to
a foundry here, to be brought to an equal thickness and to be
properly side-planed. An order given some years ago by an
English printer for a set of American printing-blocks was
afterward countermanded, on account of the prejudice against
the introduction of new things.</p>

<p>Several methods of stereotyping are now practised. Many
of the leading newspapers of England and America are printed
from stereotype plates cast in moulds made of prepared paper:
this mode, however, yields very inferior plates, quite unfit for
fine books.</p>

<p>Another method, styled the “mud-process,” is by spreading
a thin coating of pulverized soapstone and gypsum over an iron
plate, and a mould is then obtained by pressing the coated
face against a page of type. Several of these mould-plates
are then set on end in an iron box, separated from one
another by a wire of the thickness of the stereotype desired,
and hot metal is poured in. This is a very expeditious process,
though not so good as the old method.</p>

<p>In 1804, before the introduction of stereotyping into this
country, Mathew Carey, the well-known enterprising publisher
in Philadelphia, had the Bible in quarto set up entire, and regularly
imposed in chases, to print from at convenience, according
to the demand for the volume. The type was cast by Binny
&amp; Ronaldson. Stereotyping would have saved much of the
large outlay required to carry out the scheme, which, nevertheless,
even under these circumstances, was doubtless highly
remunerative. The weight of type must have amounted to
25,000 pounds, to say nothing of the number of chases and
column-rules required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<h3>ELECTROTYPING.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Stereotyping</span> has been superseded by the process of
electrotyping, as described below.</p>

<p>The pages, after being delicately polished with plumbago,
are laid in a press; a pan of prepared wax, warmed, is placed
over them and pressed down into the counter of the types.
The wax mould is then dusted with plumbago, and suspended
in the electric bath. On this, in a few hours, is deposited a
thin shell of copper, which, after being coated with tin solder,
is backed up with metal to the usual thickness of a stereotype
plate.</p>

<p>The same care in preparing the pages for electrotyping must
be observed as for stereotyping. For stereotyping, high slugs
are placed only at the top and foot of the page; but, for
electrotyping, they must be set around on all sides, and the
bevelled flange must be afterward made by side-planing.</p>

<h3>LITHOGRAPHY.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">This</span> is the art of printing, by a chemical process, from
designs made with a greasy material upon stone. It was
discovered about the beginning of the present century by
Alois Senefelder, an actor of Munich, Bavaria, whose patience
and perseverance under the most disadvantageous circumstances
were truly remarkable and praiseworthy. Differing
from all other methods of printing, the impressions are obtained
from a level surface.</p>

<p>The stone best calculated for lithographic purposes is a
sort of calcareous slate found on the banks of the Danube,
in Bavaria, the finest being found near Munich. A good
stone is porous, yet brittle, of a pale yellowish drab, and
sometimes of a gray neutral tint. The stones are formed
into slabs from one and a-half to three inches in thickness. To
prepare them for use, two stones are placed face to face with
some fine sifted sand between them, and then are rubbed
together with a circular motion, to produce the requisite
granulation, which is made finer or coarser to suit the purpose
of the artist.</p>

<p>The principal agents used for making designs on stone are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
called lithographic chalk and lithographic ink. They are
composed of tallow, virgin wax, hard tallow soap, shellac,
sometimes a little mastic or copal, and enough lampblack to
impart a colour to the mass. These ingredients are put into
an iron sauce-pan, and exposed to a strong fire till the mass
is in a state of ignition. When the quantity is reduced one-half,
the pan is carefully covered, or put into water to extinguish
the flame and cool the mixture. After being well
worked up, it is formed into small cakes or sticks. The
ingredients are the same in the chalk and the ink, but the
proportions are varied, and a little Venice turpentine is often
added to the latter. The chalk is used in a dry state; but the
ink is dissolved by rubbing in water, and is used in a pen or
with a camel-hair pencil. The presence of soap renders it
soluble in water.</p>

<p>The artist completes a drawing with the chalk upon a
grained stone as he would make a drawing in pencil or chalk
upon paper. If while in this state a wet sponge were passed
over the face of the stone, the drawing would wash off. To
prevent this, and to make it capable of yielding impressions, a
weak solution of nitrous acid is poured over it, which unites
with and neutralizes the alkali or soap contained in the chalk,
and renders it insoluble in water. After this, the usual course
is to float a solution of gum over the whole face of the stone;
and, when this is taken off, the drawing is no longer removable
by the application of a wet sponge, because the chalk is now
insoluble. The stone is now ready for the printer, who obtains
impressions by the following process.</p>

<p>Having damped the surface of the stone equally with a
sponge filled with water which has been slightly tinctured
by acid, the printer finds that the water has been imbibed
by only those parts of the stone which are not occupied by
the drawing, which, being greasy, repels the water and remains
dry. A roller covered with ink is now passed over
the stone, which will not even be soiled where it is wet, from
the antipathy of oil to water. But the parts occupied by the
drawing, being dry and greasy, have an affinity for the printing-ink,
which, therefore, leaves the roller and attaches itself
to the drawing. In this state it is said to be charged or rolled
in. A sheet of damped paper is then put over it, and, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
whole being passed through a press, the printing-ink is transferred
from the stone to the paper, and the impression is
obtained. Great nicety is requisite in the preparation of all
the agents employed in this art, and in the process of printing
as well as in making the drawing on the stone.</p>

<p>The most important application of this process is in the
production of copies of coloured drawings and paintings,—a
process known as <em>chromo-lithography</em>. The object here being
to produce as nearly as possible fac-similes in colour, touch,
and texture, as well as in drawing and light and shadow, of
pictures from the pencils of painters of the highest standing,
it has been found necessary to employ a large number of
stones, in order to produce the almost infinite varieties of
tints which are found united in a single picture,—every stone
giving a separate impression in its own particular colour or
tint. The mode of procedure is somewhat as follows. First,
an outline of the entire subject is made by means of transfer
paper, or otherwise, on a stone which is called the outline or
keystone of the work. This stone yields impressions which
are transferred as guides to all the other stones. On a second
and third stone which serve as the basis of the print the
general effect of the drawing is washed in, and from these
are printed what may be called the chiaroscuro, in a faint
tint of sepia and of a neutral colour or gray,—corresponding,
in fact, very nearly to the neutral or dead colouring of a
water-colour drawing in the method adopted by the early
water-colour painters. The stones which follow are each
charged with a particular colour or tint, and each leaves its
impression on only a particular portion of the print,—one
stone printing only the parts which are intended to be yellow
or a modification of yellow, another red, another blue, and
so on. Other stones charged in parts with grays or secondary
colours serve to blend and harmonize the crude colours;
others follow which modify these; and, finally, one gives the
sharp dark touches, and is usually followed by another which
supplies a sort of glaze or finishing wash, and subdues and
harmonizes the whole. Of course, we have merely indicated
the general method. It will be understood that the sequence
of the colours in the printing, the special quality and strength
to be given to each particular tint, the effect to be produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
by their super-position, and many other particulars, have all
to be taken into account in planning the arrangement of the
colours on the stones;—since a sequence in some respects different,
and an entirely different modification of colours, have
to be employed for the works of most artists; and it happens
that much of the colour on each of the earlier stones is
covered by that of succeeding stones, and that thus only can
the broken tints of the original be imitated. It is, in fact,
only by watching the progress of a print through all its
stages that any clear idea can be obtained of the beauty and
accuracy of the whole process, of the prevision that must
be exercised, and of the skill, care, and taste required at
every step to carry it to a successful termination. For some
of the more elaborate prints, from thirty to forty stones have
been required to produce a finished print. And in order to
produce this print, it must be borne in mind that each sheet
of paper has to be passed as many times through the press
as there are stones, since each stone imprints upon it only its
own particular section of the work. Of course, in proportion
to the increase in the number of the stones, does the difficulty
increase of making the work upon each fall exactly upon its
proper place in the general design; for, if any one were
misplaced only the fiftieth of an inch, the drawing and colour
of the whole would be disturbed. Hence it is found necessary
to arrange the <em>register</em>, or adjustment of the stones, with
the utmost care and precision, and to exercise the most
careful supervision in the printing, since the sheet of paper
expands considerably in passing through the press, and has to
be dried and re-damped before it can be passed through again.
But practically this is all accomplished with seeming ease,
and a large and most complex subject will be found, when
the last stage has been reached, to bear the most minute
scrutiny; and the result, even when the copy is placed alongside
the original, will surprise and delight equally those who
have followed the work through its several steps and those
who may only examine the completed work.</p>

<p>Of late, many chromos have been beautifully printed from
prepared blocks on an ordinary cylinder-press.</p>

<h3>ENGRAVING.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">The</span> invention of wood engraving has been claimed for
the Chinese, whose books have certainly been printed
from engraved wood blocks for ages. It is not, however,
until the beginning of the fifteenth century that we find any
evidence of the
existence of wood
engraving as we
now understand it.</p>

<p>It is probable that
Italy was the first
European country
to make engravings,
but only for
printing playing-cards.
Holland
and Germany
soon applied the
art to better ends.</p>

<p>The earliest print
of which any certain
information
can be obtained is
in the collection of
Earl Spencer. It
was discovered in
one of the most
ancient convents
of Germany,—the
Chartreuse of
Buxheim, near Memmingen in Bavaria,—pasted within the
cover of a Latin MS.; it represents Saint Christopher carrying
the infant Saviour across the sea, and is dated 1423. We give
a reduced fac-simile of this curious engraving. The inscription
at the bottom has been thus translated:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">In whichever day thou seest the likeness of St. Christopher,</div>
<div class="verse">In that same day thou wilt, at least from death, no evil blow incur.—1423.</div>

<img src="images/illus-3.jpg" width="400" height="275" alt="A copy of one of the cuts in the Apocalypsis" />
</div>

<p>Shortly afterward, a series of books printed entirely from
wood engravings, called block-books, were issued. The most
important of them were the <cite>Apocalypsis, seu Historia Sancti
Johannis</cite>; the <cite>Historia Virginis ex Cantico Canticorum</cite>;
and the <cite>Biblia Pauperum</cite>, the
last containing representations
of some of the principal passages
of the Old and New
Testaments, with explanatory
texts. The illustrations seem
to be drawn with a supreme
contempt for perspective and
proportion, but bear evidence
of the draperies and hands
and faces having been carefully
studied. The above is a
copy of one of the cuts in the
<cite>Apocalypsis</cite>. It represents St.
John preaching to three men
and a woman, with the inscription:
“<i lang="la">Conversi ab idolis, per
predicationem beati Johannis,
Drusiana et ceteri</i>,” (By the
preaching of St. John, Drusiana
and others are withdrawn from their idols.) The adjoining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
cut, from the <cite>Biblia Pauperum</cite>, is curious as showing the
general manner of representing the creation of Eve during
the fifteenth century. Both have the appearance of careful
drawings “spoiled in the engraving.” Previous to the invention
of movable types, whole books of text were also engraved
on wood, and the impressions were evidently taken
by rubbing on the back of the paper, instead of a steady
pressure, as in the printing-press, the ink used being some
kind of distemper colour.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 175px;">
<img src="images/illus-4.jpg" width="175" height="300" alt="Cut from the Biblia Pauperum" />
</div>

<p>The wood to be engraved on is carefully selected, and cut
up into transverse slices seven-eighths of an inch thick. This
is done by circular saws, which are necessarily very rigid, so
as to insure good even cuts.</p>

<p>After being cut, the slices are placed in racks something
like plate-racks, and thoroughly seasoned by slow degrees in
gradually heated rooms. When sufficiently seasoned they are
reduced to parallelograms of various sizes, the outer portion
of the circular section near the bark being cut away, and all
defective wood rejected; such, for instance, as knots, irregular
grain, as that resulting from the position of branches,
which are indicated by light-coloured markings in the wood,
known in the trade as “comets,” from their resemblance in
shape to those fiery bodies. They are softer than the surrounding
wood, and consequently do not cut well with the
graver; therefore much care and a practised eye are needed
in selecting suitable wood. A section of boxwood almost
always exhibits parts of widely different values; the more so
as it deviates from the circle in form, for then the annual rings
are compressed, and consequently closer on one side than on
the other, the side with the wide open rings being usually far
inferior in value to the denser and smaller side.</p>

<p>In former times, engravers’ blocks were cut parallel with
the grain, the present system of cutting them across the grain
being introduced about the middle of the last century. In
the preparation of a block, say for a newspaper plate, the
parallelograms before spoken of are assorted as to size and
fitted together at the back by brass bolts and nuts. So accurately
do the edges of the wood fit together, that after the
artist has finished his drawing on the smooth face of this
compound block, the screws and bolts are loosened, and the
pieces separated and given to several men to engrave the
design; all that is needed after they have finished their work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
being to fit the pieces together and screw them up again,
when they form one engraved block ready for the printing-press.</p>

<p>Turkey boxwood, from a region of country in the vicinity
of the Black Sea, is used for fine engravings. The best is of
a delicate yellow colour free from spots or “eyes,” and cuts
smoothly without crumbling or tearing.</p>

<p>The tools or gravers necessary in wood-engraving are of
three kinds,—viz., gravers proper (<i>a</i>); tint tools (<i>b</i>); and
scoopers, or cutting-out tools, for clearing out the larger
pieces (<i>c</i>). They are arranged in different sizes, to suit the
various portions of the work.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

</div>

<p>According to Vasari, the important discovery of chalcography
or engraving on brass or copper was made by Tommaso
Finiguerra, a Florentine goldsmith of the fifteenth century,
who lived from 1400 to 1460. The manner in which he
made this discovery is thus stated by the Rev. T. F. Dibdin:—</p>

<p>“Of engraving upon copper, the earliest known impression
is that executed by one Tommaso Finiguerra, a goldsmith
of Florence, with the date of 1460 upon it. One of
the following circumstances is supposed to have given rise
to the discovery. Finiguerra chanced to cast, or let fall, a
piece of copper, engraved and filled with ink, into melted
sulphur; and, observing that the exact impression of his
work was left on the sulphur, he repeated the experiment
on moistened paper, rolling it gently with a roller. This
origin has been admitted by Lord Walpole and Mr. Landseer;
but another has been also mentioned by Huber. ‘It
is reported,’ says he, ‘that a washerwoman left some linen
upon a plate or dish on which Finiguerra had just been engraving,
and that an impression of the subject engraved,
however imperfect, came off upon the linen, occasioned by
its weight and moistness.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<h3>PHOTO-ENGRAVING.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Photo-engravings</span> are produced by means of photography.
It is a fact worthy of note that experiments in
photographic engraving gave rise to photography itself. The
aim of Nicéphore Niepce, when he began his researches in
1813, was not only to fix the image obtained by the camera
obscura on a plate of metal, but to convert this plate into
an engraving which could be used on a printing-press. His
early death prevented his perfecting the process to which he
had devoted much time and study.</p>

<p>Three distinct methods of photo-engraving are employed
in the United States, viz.: swelled gelatine, photo-etching,
and wash-out. The latter is known as photo-electrotyping.</p>

<p>The first steps to produce a plate by any of these processes
are exactly alike, <i>i. e.</i> a perfectly sharp negative, either in line
or stipple, must be produced. If the copy furnished is a
wood-cut, steel or lithographic print, in which the lines are
absolutely black on white paper or card, the negative is made
direct and no drawing is necessary, unless a very great reduction
is required, when it becomes necessary to make a drawing,
the lines of which are made open enough to stand the necessary
reduction. Where the copy furnished is a photograph,
or wash drawing, it is first photographed one half larger, or,
where fine work is desired, twice the size the plate required.
In cases where exceptionally fine work is required it is even
made three times the size. The photograph thus obtained
is technically termed a silver print, and is an untoned print on
plain paper. On this silver print the artist makes his drawing,
using the best India ink, which must be so black that the finest
hair-line, when examined through a magnifying glass, appears
absolutely jet black. After the drawing is made, an alcoholic
solution of bichloride of mercury is poured over it, and
quickly washed under the tap, leaving the drawing on perfectly
white paper. The artist then does whatever retouching may
be necessary, and the drawing is ready to be photographed.
The advantages of this method of drawing are apparent.
The artist, being able to work directly on the enlarged photograph
of the object, obtains absolutely correct outlines and
detail. The drawing, when finished, is sent to the gallery,
where it is photographed to the required size of the plate. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
focus of the camera is carefully adjusted with the aid of a
focusing glass, so that the negative resulting will be perfectly
sharp. This must be carefully done, for unless the negative
be sharp a perfect plate cannot be obtained by any process.
The sensitized collodion plate is exposed in the camera from
one to six minutes, after which it is taken again to the dark
room, developed, and fixed. It is then intensified until the
portions representing the whites of the picture are perfectly
opaque. Up to this point all the processes are alike, and
the differences from here will be noted.</p>

<p>If the plate is to be produced by the <em>swelled gelatine</em> process,
the negative is varnished and sent to the gelatine room. Here
the gelatine is dissolved and the sensitized solution of bichromate
of potash is added, and it is flowed on plate glass, then
placed in a drying box, where a current of air is continually
passed over it. When the gelatine is dry it is placed in a printing
frame, in close contact with the negative, and exposed to
the light. On removing the negative the picture is plainly
seen on the gelatine, the action of the light having changed
the color of the exposed portions of the gelatine, besides rendering
those parts insoluble, while the parts protected from
the action of the light, by the opacity of the negative, remain
soluble, and are swelled up by immersion in cold water. The
gelatine is then an exact opposite of the plate, the <em>whites</em>
being represented by the raised portions. From this mould,
or relief, a cast is made in a preparation of wax or plaster,
when it is ready for the stereotyper.</p>

<p>For the <em>wash-out</em> or photo-electrotype process, the negative,
when dry, is not varnished, but is first coated with a
rubber solution and then with plain collodion, after which it
is immersed in a dish of acetic acid for about five minutes,
when it is stripped from the glass and turned over. It is then
what is termed a reversed negative. The method of preparing
the gelatine is very much the same as for the <em>swelled</em> process,
with the exception that it is <em>cooked</em> for about forty-eight
hours, and with the addition of several preparations which
are introduced at the time of sensitizing, to make it easily
washed out. The negative is exposed in the same manner
as described before, but the time of exposure is generally
less. After being taken from the printing frame the gelatine
is gently scrubbed with a line brush, and kept in tepid water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
until a very slight relief is obtained. It is then immersed in
alcohol for a few seconds, and dried with a cloth, when it is
covered with a preparation of lamp black and glycerine, which
is allowed to remain about five minutes, when the surface of
the plate is carefully rubbed with clean muslin, exposing the
surface of the lines,—all this being done in a dark room before
an orange light, which is non-actinic. The gelatine is now
placed in a frame and exposed to the light from five to twenty
minutes, the lampblack protecting the spaces between the
lines from the action of the light, so that those portions remain
soluble. The gelatine is again scrubbed until the proper relief
is obtained, after which it is allowed to dry for about twelve
hours, when it becomes hard and is ready to be electrotyped.</p>

<p>The negatives for photo-etching are stripped and reversed
in the same manner as for the <em>wash-out</em> process. The metal
generally employed for this process is zinc, though copper is
sometimes used for very fine work. The zinc is very highly
polished, and a thin sensitizing solution is flowed over it and
dried, after which it is exposed under the negative to the
action of the light. It is then rolled up with lithographic ink,
placed in a dish of cold water, and gently rubbed with absorbent
cotton, the ink readily leaving the unexposed parts, but
remaining on the exposed lines or dots. It is then quickly
dried and dusted over with dragon’s-blood powder, which adheres
only to the remaining inked portions. The plate is then
heated and cooled, and is ready for the etching bath, which
consists of a small portion of nitric acid and water. After the
first <em>bite</em> the plate is again powdered, heated and cooled,
and more acid added to the bath. This is repeated several
times, after which the plate is ready for the press. The sides
of the lines are protected by the manner in which the powder
is applied after the first <em>bite</em>. The relief obtained in this way
is greater than can be obtained by any other process.</p>

<p>In reviewing the three processes above described, it is
readily seen that the photo-etching process is the shorter
method, no moulding or casting being necessary, and the
sharpness of the finest lines is preserved in a manner impossible
by the other methods. The plates are much deeper, and are
equally suitable for the finest art work, down to the roughest
newspaper work. This process, of which there are several
modes of operating, has become very popular in the last few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
years, owing to the many improvements introduced by the
<em>process inventors</em>, who have turned their attention to it. It
has many advantages, among which is the fact that a plate
can be put on the press within two hours from the time the
copy is ready; and the wearing capacity of the plates is
greater. By this process more than 300,000 impressions have
been taken from plates of fine work, while swelled gelatine
plates of the same character of work would not stand over
5000, and electrotypes 50,000 impressions. The main advantage
of photo-etchings to the printer is, that the plates do
not require constant washing up, as is the case with plates
made by the other processes.</p>

<p>A photograph, brush drawing, or any copy that is not made
up of line or stipple, can be produced without the necessity
of a line drawing by the aid of the half-tone process. There
are several of these processes in operation in this country;
and, although originally introduced in Germany by Miesenbach,
it has been so improved by American inventors that the European
work is far below the standard of the United States. The
principal methods of <em>half-tone</em> in this country are worked
secretly by the inventors, each having modifications and improvements
of his own. It is impossible to give a thorough
description here, as none of the inventors are willing to risk
patenting their processes, and a complete publication is not
desirable. The copy is first photographed, giving a negative
with all the details of the original. This negative is then exposed
to the camera, and the result is a <em>positive</em>, or, as commonly
called, a transparency. This positive is then placed in
contact with a glass plate covered with ruled lines. This plate
is termed a <em>grating</em>. Being placed in contact, they are then
photographed together, giving a negative of the object made
up of lines and dots, representing the lights and shades of the
picture. Here the half-tone process ends, the resulting plate
being produced by any of the photo-engraving methods; but
the most satisfactory results are obtained by photo-etching.
The main objection to the half-tone plates is their lack of relief.
No great depth can be obtained without sacrificing the effect.
In printing these plates the greatest care in <em>making ready</em>
must be exercised, and a smooth surface paper must be used.
It is also necessary that a fine grade of ink be used in small
quantity, and that it should be properly distributed.</p>

<h3>A WALK OVER OUR FOUNDRY.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Mr. Typograph</span>, how are you, sir? Glad to see you.
How is business with you? Plenty to do, and customers
paying up? You are so prompt in paying us, that we
have no doubt you have a noble set of customers. You wish
to add to your stock our new things? All right, sir. You
have a fine office already, but you want to keep up with the
times, and give your patrons the best the type-founder can
invent? That’s the way, sir. The man on the lookout sees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the sun the earliest. Mr. Faithful, show our new things to Mr.
Typograph, and take his order.</p>

<p>You say, Mr. Typograph, that you have never gone over a
type-foundry? We shall be happy to show you every thing.
This way, sir. Here is the metal-house. These piles of dull
lead, these casks of sparkling antimony, this copper, and
this tin go to form the grand amalgam of which type
is made. The worthy and kind-hearted man who is
stirring at the kettle, unites, in bonds stronger than
matrimony, immense masses of these metals every
week. It may appear to you, Mr. Typograph, to be
an exceedingly simple thing to throw into the kettle
certain amounts of lead and antimony, and copper and
tin, and produce type-metal. Not so, good friend. It
is not an easy matter to compose a metal that shall
be hard, yet not brittle; ductile, yet tough; flowing
freely, yet hardening quickly. All these conditions
must be met. Break a bar in two, and examine the
grain of our metal: is it not beautiful?</p>

<img src="images/tools-matrix.jpg" width="55" height="200" alt="" />
<p class="caption">MATRIX.</p>
</div>

<p>Now, sir, let us up-stairs and see how these bars are fitted
for printers’ use. This is a punch-cutter—a man of
exquisite finger and unerring eye—sitting amid keen
and delicate tools and accurate gauges. There are
but few of this kind of men in the world. On the end
of a piece of steel he is forming a letter. A touch
here and a touch there, and frequent testing by
gauges,—so he proceeds, till the letter is done; then
another, and another, till the alphabet is complete;
all the letters harmonizing entirely in height, breadth,
appearance, length of stroke, &amp;c. A smoke-proof
of the dies is taken, and if approved the dies are one
by one placed in a stamping-machine, so,—and an
oblong piece of copper is set under it, so,—and then
this lever is brought down, so,—and a perfect impression
of the die is left, as you see, deep in the
copper. This is the matrix. The matrices are passed over to
other workmen in the adjoining room. Observe now the
carefulness and skill exercised in fitting up these bits of copper,
so that, when placed in the mould, the types cast in them
shall range accurately and be of uniform height. The slightest
variation would give the zigzag appearance which you may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
have noticed in badly-made type. This we endeavour sedulously
to avoid, and with how much success you can judge
from our Specimen Book. Look at this drawer full of matrices.
You say they are triumphs of art? True saying,
evincive of good judgment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/machine-casting.jpg" width="350" height="450" alt="" />
<p class="caption">CASTING MACHINE.</p>
</div>

<p>You wonder what these curious-looking instruments are
which lie, in dusty repose, on the shelves around the room?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Those, Mr. Typograph, are hand-moulds, and at one time
they provoked intense covetousness on the part of rival
founders. One of our earliest predecessors, Mr. Archibald
Binny (our foundry dates from 1796), added such valuable
improvements to the ordinary mould, that no other foundry
in the world could rival the expedition and accuracy with
which types were cast in the establishment of which he was
a co-proprietor. Their day has passed, however. They have
been superseded by the machines which you will see in
operation in another apartment. But they were capital things
in their time, sir, and we regard them with somewhat of an
antiquary’s reverence.</p>

<p>Now we enter the casting-rooms. These tiny machines,
small as they are, can throw out more type in one day than
you would be likely to count in a month, even if you could
call off one hundred a minute, and occupy ten hours a day.
Snug little fellows, are they not? They were invented by a
New-Yorker, Mr. David Bruce, Jr. A very ingenious man,
you say? That is true. Look at one carefully. The metal is
kept fluid by a little furnace underneath, and is projected into
the mould by a pump, the spout of which, you see, is in front
of the metal-pot. The mould is movable, and at every revolution
of the crank it comes up to the spout, receives a charge
of metal, and flies back with a fully-formed type in its bosom;
the upper half of the mould lifts, and out jumps a type as
lively as a tadpole. You don’t see how the letter is formed
on the end of the type? True, we had forgotten: well, this
spring in front holds in loving proximity to the mould a copper
matrix, such as you saw just now in the fitting-room.
The letter a, for instance, stamped in the matrix, sits directly
opposite the aperture in the mould which meets the spout of
the pump; and when a due proportion of a’s is cast, another
matrix with b stamped in it takes its place; and so on throughout
the alphabet. Slow work, you say, one at a time? Well,
the world is peopled after that fashion; and it fills up fast
enough. But just time this machine: it is making small, thin
type. Count the type made in a minute. One hundred and
seventy-five, you say. One hundred per minute will probably
be the average of the ordinary sizes of printing type.</p>

<p>The types are not finished yet? Oh, no. These nimble-fingered
boys are breaking off the jets, or waste ends of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
type. Quick, a’n’t they? Now let us go up stairs into the
dressing-room. An immense beehive? Yes, indeed, it looks
like one. The lads clustered around the large circular stones,
with leather-protected fingers, rub off the rough edges of the
type. But men as well as type require their rough edges
taken off before they are good for much in the world. These
boys at the tables set up the type in long lines. You think
that if you could pick up dollars as fast as they pick up type,
you would retire an independent man in a year or two? We
wish you could, Mr. Typograph; we wish you could.</p>

<p>The lines of type now pass into the hands of the dresser.
Observe how deftly he slips them into a long stick, shakes
them down on their face, screws them up, fastens them into a
planing-board, and with one or two pushes with a planing tool
accurately grooves the bottom of the type, removing entirely
the burr left when the jet is broken off, and giving each type
a pair of legs to stand upon, till it is worn out and returned
to the melting kettle. What is the eye-glass used for? Why,
sir, as soon as the types are grooved, the dresser narrowly
inspects the face of the type, and if an imperfect letter is discovered
by the aid of the magnifying glass, it is incontinently
turned out. Ah, sir, if we were all inspected as severely as he
criticises type, some of us, perhaps, would hardly pass muster.
The immaculate types are next put up in pages of convenient
size, and are ready for the purchaser.</p>

<p>Let us drop into the large machine-room. Does not every
thing hum here! Is it not a beautiful sight to see the shafts
and belts and pulleys whirling around as if they were all
alive? Here we fit up our machines, make our moulds, repair
damages to machinery, &amp;c. The multifarious uses of
these lathes you must be familiar with: this ponderous machine
is an iron planer: how it makes the iron chips fly!
What is that curiously-arranged lathe? That is for cutting
Labour-Saving Rule,—the rule which you have found so convenient
and economical in your job-room. We make it of
many different styles of faces: some single, some dotted or
hyphen-lines, and others parallel or double, of varying thicknesses.
They are all cut to Pica ems in length, and are
furnished with mitred corner-pieces of different angles, so
contrived, in most of the sizes, as to allow the rule to be used
single or double, and with the fine lines inside or outside.</p>

<p class="caption">SLOTTED BRASS CORNERS.</p>
</div>

<p>Here are specimens of our new slotted brass corners, so
handsome and useful to the skilled printer. See how accurately
the slotted pieces fit in one another, so that you cannot
detect the joint. Are they not effective? Our brass is carefully
rolled by the best manufacturers in the country, and is
sent to us in strips or in sheets. That wicked-looking shears
yonder cuts up the thinner brass with as much unction as
Commissioner Yeh’s executioner slices off heads: the thick
brass goes under a circular steam-saw.</p>

<p class="caption">STEREOTYPE BLOCK.</p>
</div>

<p>Now, sir, while we are up here, we will peep into the
printers’ furnishing-room. Isn’t this a beautiful stereotype-block?
Doesn’t it do your eyes good to look at such perfect
workmanship? And these
brass galleys, and mahogany
galleys and composing
sticks, are they not admirable?
Our effort in this department,
as in all others,
is to do our work well. All
our miscellaneous wood-work is done here,—stands, racks,
drawers, stereotype and packing boxes, &amp;c. Some curious
work has been designed and executed for the Smithsonian
Institution, as well as brass ciphering-frames for the blind.</p>

<p>Ah, we forgot to show you our large-type room. On our
way to the electrotype department, we will glance in it. The
types you see here cool too slowly to be cast in a machine,
so we continue to pour them. Look over the drawers, and
see the multitude of patterns. Some men fancy one style,
and some another. So we try to meet all tastes. Feel how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
solid the type is. You can’t squeeze the life out of that type
on a power-press. No, indeed. It is made for wear.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Typograph, we enter the grimed and murky
electrotype-room. Electrotyping, you are aware, is simply
stereotyping in copper. Its advantages over stereotyping
are, sharpness of outline in plates from wood-cuts, and great
durability. Plates for books of large circulation are always
electrotyped, as well as cuts, engravings, binders’ stamps, &amp;c.
The thing to be electrotyped, after being carefully and almost
imperceptibly glazed with plumbago, is laid upon a press, and
a prepared mould is placed over it, and an exact impression
taken. This is well dusted with plumbago, and then deposited
in the electric bath. Nature immediately takes up her part
of the work, and a brilliant coating of copper is deposited
upon the mould. When sufficiently thick, it is taken out of
the battery, and, as you may notice, presents on the wrong
side the appearance of a printed sheet of copper. This sheet
is then filled up on the back to the requisite degree of thickness,
and fastened to a block, ready to be used with type on
a common printing-press. Plumbago, you remark, does not
improve the countenances of the operatives? True; but a
little soap and water, vigorously applied, proves the title of
these intelligent workmen to rank among white folk.</p>

<p>To you, Mr. Typograph, our composing-rooms present nothing
new, except, perhaps, in its vast number of job founts,
due to the fact that we now mainly confine our work in this
department to all kinds of jobbing; and yet in ten years we
have set up in these rooms and stereotyped more than eight
hundred considerable works,—most of them consisting of a
single volume, but some of from two to twelve volumes each,—besides
a multitude of smaller books, tracts, &amp;c. Among
the rest we may mention two Quarto Bibles, (one of them,
now published by J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co., the grandest ever got
up in America,) Lippincott’s two great Gazetteers, Dr. Kane’s
Explorations, The North American Sylva, Thiers’ Napoleon,
and Macaulay’s England: Allibone’s magnificent Dictionary
of Authors and Books among the number.</p>

<p>After the pages have been set and carefully read, they are
sent down to the casting-room. In the electrotype-room,
every thing is as black as the brow of a coal-heaver: in the
casting-room, all is as white as the neck of a belle. Take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
care, sir, or your coat will commit a larceny of our plaster.
The form of type is laid on this stone, and nicely oiled: and
then a mixture of plaster and water—doesn’t it look like a
good wife’s buckwheat batter?—is poured over it, and gently
rolled in. In a short time the plaster sets, and the mould is
removed by screws as tenderly as a nurse handles a baby. It
is then dried in this hot-tempered oven, and, after the moisture
is all evaporated, it is laid in a pan and fastened tightly, as
you see, and plunged into this terrible bath of a thousand
pounds of molten type-metal. Phew! you exclaim, what
warm work! Yes, sir; but from that fiery sea of lead soon
emerges the pan, and its hissing heat is gradually overcome
by the water in the trough into which the pan is lowered.
Now, caster, break it out. There, Mr. Typograph, is the plate,
fixed,—immovable,—stereotyped. The mould is ruined; but
the plate is comparatively immortalized. It is rough yet, and,
like an uncouth boy, needs polishing.</p>

<p class="caption">STEREOTYPE CASTING-ROOM.</p>
</div>

<p>This next room is the finishing-room. Here the plates are
carefully examined, picked, shaved, trimmed, and boxed,
ready for the printer. Take a plate in your hand and examine
it: it will bear inspection. You say it is far better than the
untrimmed, uneven plates of English founders? We know
that, sir; for we have often had to re-finish English plates imported
by some publisher who imagined he could save a little
by ordering a duplicate set of plates of a popular foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
book. A mistake, sir. Both in type-founding and in stereotyping
the Americans have driven the foreigner from the field,—and
in the only legitimate way, too: simply by surpassing
him.</p>

<p>In this nook below, our engraving is done. The drawing
is made on the block by the designer, as you see: then
patiently and skilfully the engraver cuts and digs out, till the
lines and shapes and lights and shades are all revealed in the
beautiful picture. Our work in this department gives so much
satisfaction that we are seldom without orders.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Typograph, we shall admit you into our editorial
parlour. Walk in, sir. It is not carpeted, and its principal
furnishings comprise a desk or two, a few presses, stands and
cases, with multitudinous type-surroundings. Here, sir, we
edit and print our Specimen Books and our Typographic
Advertiser. Don’t you see poetical flies buzzing around, and
atoms of wit-dust floating in the air, and odours of sentiment
stealing out at the key-holes, and grains of common sense
sprinkled all over the floor. Will you have a few specimens
as curiosities? You say you have already a good assortment
in our Advertiser and our Book? Very well, sir: we hope you
will treasure them up. You say truly when you remark, that
the printing done in this room is seldom, if ever, surpassed
in America. We know that; and we intend to stand on the
topmost round of the typographical ladder, and to show
our fellow-artists what can be done with type such as we
manufacture.</p>

<p>We are afraid, Mr. Typograph, that your long excursion
over the house has wearied you. Let us go down-stairs again.
These, sir, are our warerooms. On these numerous shelves
are ranged founts of all the various sorts of types made by
us, carefully put up, labelled and classified, and all accessible
at a minute’s notice. Our customers throughout the country
keep actively employed all these porters, packers, clerks,
salesmen, and bookkeepers. Many of our customers have
never visited us; but we put up their orders with as conscientious
fidelity and care as if they were standing before us and
watching our every movement. We are happy to see them,
and hope none will visit our city without calling in and taking
us by the hand. We like to see them face to face, so that we
can hang up their portraits in our mental gallery; and, when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
afterward receive a letter from them, we can imagine that we
are hearing them talk to us rather than reading their writing.</p>

<p>The side-door on which your eye has just rested leads to
one of our fire-proofs. Enter it. Here, sir, are safely stored
many thousand matrices, as well as moulds, when not in use.
As it would require the labour of many weary years to replace
them if destroyed, we endeavour to keep them secure from
the danger of ruin by fire. The upbuilding of a complete
type-foundry is a work of generations.</p>

<p>You will hardly care to look into the basement,—the storehouse
of ink and other typographical appliances? Your time
is exhausted? Then, sir, we bid you good-day. A safe return
to your pleasant family, Mr. Typograph.</p>

<img src="images/dropcap-thetypes.jpg" width="150" height="250" alt="Words THE TYPES laid out in a composing stick" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">The types</span> or letters generally used for printing in
Europe and America are termed
<i>Roman</i>, <i>Italic</i>, and <i>Old English</i>, or
<i>Black Letter</i>.</p>

<h4 class="clearnone">ROMAN LETTER.</h4>

<p><span class="word1-smcap">Roman</span> letters were employed
in MSS. from the fifth to about the
close of the twelfth century, when
what are called Gothic letters (afterward
Old English) came gradually
into use; these continued for several
centuries, when, in most countries,
they were superseded by the
Roman characters. All printing
was in black letter down to 1465,
when Sweinheim &amp; Pannartz, in Subiaco near Rome, produced
a volume entitled <cite>Lactantius</cite>, in a character approaching to
the actual forms of our modern types. In 1467, they made
an improved set of characters, and printed about forty volumes
within the five years following. About 1469 John of Spires,
in Venice, made a great advance in improving the form of the
Roman character, and printed the <cite>Natural History of Pliny</cite>:
the execution of this work is very remarkable. But Nicholas
Jenson may fairly be considered the father of the style of
Roman letter now in vogue. He printed in Venice four works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
in the year 1470, the first of which was <cite>Eusebii Præparatio
Novorum</cite>, &amp;c., in types which were cut by him, more perfect
in form than those of any earlier printer. The printers named
above were all of them Germans.</p>

<p>The Roman letters consist of circles, arcs of circles, and
straight lines; and, therefore, on the score of simplicity, precision,
and elegance, they certainly deserve to be adopted as
the standard for all nations.</p>

<p>A printer, in choosing type, should not only attend to the
cut of the letter, but should also observe that its shank is perfectly
true, and that it lines or ranges with accuracy, and is
of equal height. The quality of the metal of which it is composed
and the finish of the letter demand particular attention,
as the competition among some of the smaller foundries
(which have sprung into existence through the facilities afforded
of multiplying <em>matrices</em> by the electrotype process)
has led them to use an inferior metal, and produce types
without due regard to nicety of finish and exactness of body
and standing.</p>

<p>It is important that types should have a deep face, with
strong, bevelled bases or foundations under the ceriphs or
hairlines, and that the letters should have a deep nick, which
should be different from other founts of like body in the same
house.</p>

<h4>ITALIC LETTER.</h4>

<p><i>Aldo Manuccio, born at Bassano, succeeded Jenson at Venice
and turned to good account the latter’s admirable founts of
type. He also made many advances in the art of printing, the
most notable of which is the invention of the style of type now
known as Italic. It was first used in an octavo edition of Virgil
issued by him in 1501, and Pope Leo X. gave him a letter of
privilege, entitling him to the sole use of the type he had invented.
It was said to be founded on the handwriting of
Petrarch, which it closely resembles.</i></p>

<p>Italic was largely employed to distinguish such parts of a
book as might be considered appendages, as <i>Prefaces</i>, <i>Introductions</i>,
<i>Annotations</i>, &amp;c., all of which were formerly printed
in this character; so that perhaps two-fifths of a fount was
composed of Italic letter.</p>

<p>At present it is used more sparingly, being superseded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the more elegant mode of enclosing extracts within inverted
commas, and by setting poetry and annotations in a smaller-sized
type. It is very appropriately used to distinguish the
head or subject-matter of a chapter, and is serviceable in grammars
and other school-books as well as scientific works. The
frequent use of Italic words among Roman in ordinary matter
impairs the beauty of the page, and ought to be avoided;
yet authors sometimes stubbornly insist on the gratification
of their whimsies, even at the sacrifice of every principle of
correct taste.</p>

<h4>BLACK LETTER.</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<img src="images/type-blackletter.jpg" width="400" height="100" alt="" />

<p class="gothic">This letter, which was used in the infancy of
Printing, descended from the Gothic characters: it
is called Gothic by some, and Old English by
others; but printers term it Black Letter, on account
of its heavy appearance.</p>

</div>

<p>In Germany, the letters in common use are founded on
the Gothic character; but even there scientific works are
printed in the German language with Roman letters.</p>

<p>The Dutch adhere to the black letter in books of devotion
and religious treatises; while they make use of the Roman in
their curious and learned works.</p>

<h4>SAXON CHARACTERS.</h4>

<p><span class="word1-smcap">The</span> Saxon characters originated probably from the Gothic,
but were altered or modified after the Latin ones which the
Saxons found in use in England in the fifth century. The
first Saxon types were cut by John Daye, under the patronage
of Archbishop Parker, about the year 1567. We give the
Lord’s Prayer in modern Anglo-Saxon types:</p>

<p>Besides the foregoing, a smaller size than Diamond, called
Brilliant, is now cast in the foundry of MacKellar, Smiths &amp;
Jordan of Philadelphia, the body of which is just one-half of
Minion. Even this is surpassed in smallness by a music type
cast in the same foundry, named Excelsior, which is precisely
one-half the size of Nonpareil. Another size omitted in the
list is Minionette, (equivalent to six of the Didot points,)
which is next above Nonpareil.</p>

<p>Canon is conceded to have been first produced by a French
artisan, and was probably used in some work relating to the
canons of the church; to which the German title, Missal, alludes.</p>

<p>Two-line Great Primer, Two-line English, and Two-line
Pica, owe their names to the respective bodies of which the
depth of two em quadrates answers to one of the double sizes.</p>

<p>Paragon was probably first cut in France. It is known as
Text by the Germans.</p>

<p>Pica is universally considered as the standard type, and by
it furniture, quotations and labour-saving rules are graduated.
A line 83 Pica ems long is equivalent to 35 centimeters. The
twelfth part of Pica is the unit, called a Point, by which
type-bodies are measured. MacKellar, Smiths &amp; Jordan cast
their new borders, ornaments, and job type on Pica, and its
subdivisions of Nonpareil, (½ Pica,) and Excelsior, (¼ Pica,)
and their multiples.</p>

<img src="images/type-size-1.jpg" width="600" height="1900" alt="Image of the different type sizes" />

<p>Great Primer, called Tertia in
Germany, is one of the major
sizes of type which were early
used for printing considerable
works, and especially the Bible;
on which account some persons
term it Bible Text. The French
name is Gros Romain.</p>

<p>English is called Mittel by the Germans,
and St. Augustin by the French
and Dutch; the word Mittel (Middle)
intimating that the former sizes of letter
were seven in number, the centre of
which was English, with Prima, Secunda,
and Tertia on one side, and Pica, Long
Primer, and Brevier on the other. The
name St. Augustin was probably given
because the writings of that Father were
the first works done in that letter.</p>

<p>Pica is called Cicero by the French and
Germans. As the preceding size was distinguished
by the name of St. Augustin, so this
has been honoured with that of Cicero, on
account of the Epistles of that writer having
been first done in letter of this size. It is
doubtful whether the name was given by the
French or the Germans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Small Pica is a grade below Pica, and is now generally
employed in octavo volumes, and is, indeed,
almost the only size used for printing legal reports
and other law books. The French call this letter
Philosophie, which, however, is merely a Pica face on
Small Pica body. The Germans call it Kleine Cicero.</p>

<p>Long Primer. Upon the supposition that some bodies
of letter took their names from works in which they were
first employed, we are induced to believe that the Germans
gave the name of Corpus to this character on account of their
Corpus Juris being first done in this size. The French
call this letter Petit Romain.</p>

<p>Bourgeois is a very useful and convenient size of letter. It
is frequently used in double-column octavo pages. The name
indicates that it originated in France; although type of this
body is now called Gaillarde by French printers. Two lines
of this letter are equivalent to one line of Great Primer, or
four lines of Diamond.</p>

<p>Brevier was first used for printing the Breviaries, or Roman
Catholic Church books, and hence its name. The Germans call
it Petit, and Jungfer (maiden letter). It is an admirable type,
and cannot conveniently be dispensed with in any considerable
printing-office.</p>

<p>Minion follows Brevier, and is commonly used for newspapers, and
for notes and indexes in book-work. Its name is due probably to its
being smaller than any type in use at the period of its invention. It
fills a useful place in a printing-office.</p>

<p>Nonpareil came next in order; and its originator, supposing that he had
reached the extreme of diminutiveness, gave it this triumphant title. It is extensively
used, though mostly on newspapers, and for notes and indexes for duodecimo
books and smaller. It is certainly the smallest type that should be
allowed in book-work.</p>

<p>Agate probably arose from the necessities of newspaper publishers. As patronage increased,
it became desirable to have a type less in size than Nonpareil, for the advertisements,
shipping news, markets, &amp;c.; and Agate was made to meet the emergency. It is
now extensively used for pocket editions of the Bible and Prayer Books.</p>

<p>Pearl may be said to have been born of ambition. As punch-cutters became more expert, some
one possessed of a keen eye and a delicate mechanical finger determined to surpass in smallness
the achievements of his predecessors. Hence the origin of this type. This type is also employed
in printing miniature volumes.</p>

<p>Diamond followed, as a matter of course; for human ingenuity, when provoked, seems determined to go to the
utmost verge of possibility. This type is so minute that a pound of it will contain more than 3300 of the letter i;
yet, to produce each letter of an alphabet, a steel punch has to be cut and a matrix made, in which the types are
cast one by one, and, being set up in lines, are rubbed and dressed by the founder for the use of the compositor.</p>

<p>Brilliant. Expert penmen, it is said, have succeeded in writing the Lord’s Prayer upon the edge of a sheet of paper. A type-setter
in Berlin, most surprisingly, has formed a type so minute as to be scarcely readable without a good magnifying glass. The type
of this paragraph, though not so small as the microscopic letters produced in Prussia, is yet so diminutive that even Diamond is large
by comparison. Of the letter i nearly 4600 go to a pound.</p>

<h3>GRADATION OF TYPES.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">The</span> following specimen shows the proportion which one
size of type bears to another in <em>width</em>; but it is necessary
to observe that it must be taken with certain limitations, because
each founder has letter of every size that will either
drive out or get in with others of the same body, some faces
being more extended and others being more condensed than
the standard width of type. The scale contains thirteen sizes
in order of gradation, viz., Great Primer, English, Pica, Small
Pica, Long Primer, Bourgeois, Brevier, Minion, Nonpareil,
Agate, Pearl, Diamond, and Brilliant.</p>

<h3>POINT SYSTEM OF TYPE-BODIES.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">In</span> 1882, MacKellar, Smiths &amp; Jordan began to make type
on the proportional system of bodies. The Pica em,
being the eighty-third part of thirty five centimetres, was
divided into twelve parts, or points. This system of exact
proportional type-bodies was approved of and adopted by
the American type-founders generally. It has been favourably
received by printers in this country, and all printing
offices will in due time be fully equipped with types of this
description.</p>

<p>The standard for the height of type was fixed at 2⅓ centimetres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>In some European countries printing offices had their
types cast to a height to suit the proprietor’s whim. Some
of the foreign founders have sent young men to Philadelphia
to be educated in the American system of heights and bodies,
and at least two foundries in Germany have adopted the
American plan.</p>

<p>The following table shows the systematic gradation of
bodies and position of nicks in the point system, one point
being equivalent to 1/12 of a Pica em.</p>

<p>Owing to the varying styles of authors and the diverse subjects
of books, some letters will now and then run short in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
fount, whatever the proportions may have been at first. A new
fount of type may run evenly on a work in general literature
written in the third person, while a novel filled with dialogues
in the first person will rapidly exhaust certain letters, and require
sorts to render the fount serviceable to its full general
capacity. So with scientific and other books. Even in the
case of two authors writing on the same subject, there is no
certainty that the fount will run alike. The master-printer,
therefore, to keep the entire letter in use, is compelled to
order sorts, and his fount is thus constantly growing larger.</p>

<h4>CAPITALS.</h4>

<p><span class="word1-smcap">Lindley Murray</span> gives the following judicious directions
in regard to the use of capital letters:—</p>

<p>It was formerly the custom to begin every noun with a
capital; but as this practice was troublesome, and gave the
writing or printing a crowded and confused appearance, it has
been discontinued. It is, however, very proper to begin with
a capital,—</p>

<p>1. The first word of every book, chapter, letter, note, or
any other piece of writing; and,</p>

<p>2. The first word after a period; and, if the two sentences
are <em>totally independent</em>, after a note of interrogation or exclamation.
But if a number of interrogative or exclamatory sentences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
are thrown into one general group, or if the construction
of the latter sentences depends on the former, all of them,
except the first, may begin with a small letter: as, <i>How long,
ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight
in their scorning? and fools hate knowledge?</i>—<i>Alas!
how different! yet how like the same!</i></p>

<p>3. The appellations of the Deity: as, <i>God</i>, <i>Jehovah</i>, <i>the
Almighty</i>, <i>the Supreme Being</i>, <i>the Lord</i>, <i>Providence</i>, <i>the Messiah</i>,
<i>the Holy Spirit</i>.</p>

<p>4. Proper names of persons, places, streets, mountains,
rivers, ships: as, <i>George</i>, <i>London</i>, <i>the Strand</i>, <i>the Alps</i>, <i>the
Thames</i>, <i>the Seahorse</i>.</p>

<p>5. Adjectives derived from the proper names of places: as,
<i>Grecian</i>, <i>Roman</i>, <i>English</i>, <i>French</i>, <i>Italian</i>.</p>

<p>6. The first word of a quotation, introduced after a colon,
or when it is in a direct form: as, <i>Always remember this
ancient maxim: “Know thyself.”</i>—<i>Our great Lawgiver says,
“Take up thy cross daily, and follow me.”</i> But when a quotation
is brought in obliquely after a comma, a capital letter is
unnecessary: as, <i>Solomon observes, “that pride goes before destruction.”</i></p>

<p>The first word of an example may also very properly begin
with a capital: as, <i>Temptation proves our virtue</i>.</p>

<p>7. Every substantive and principal word in the titles of
books: as, <cite>Johnson’s Dictionary of the English Language</cite>;
<cite>Thomson’s Seasons</cite>; <cite>Rollin’s Ancient History</cite>.</p>

<p>8. The first word of every line in poetry.</p>

<p>9. The pronoun <i>I</i> and the interjection <i>O</i> are written in
capitals: as, <i>I write: Hear, O earth!</i></p>

<p>Other words, besides the preceding, may begin with capitals
when they are remarkably emphatical, or the principal subject
of the composition.</p>

<p>The method of denoting capital letters in manuscript is by
underscoring them with <span class="u3">three distinct lines</span>.</p>

<h4>SMALL CAPITALS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Small Capitals</span> are in general cast to Roman founts only,
and are used for the purpose of giving a stronger emphasis
to a word than that conveyed by Italic. They are likewise
used for running heads, heads of chapters, &amp;c. The first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
word of every section or chapter is commonly put in small
capitals; but when a two-line initial letter is used, the remainder
of the word should be in capitals.</p>

<p>The small capitals <span class="smcapuc">C</span>, <span class="smcapuc">O</span>, <span class="smcapuc">S</span>, <span class="smcapuc">V</span>, <span class="smcapuc">W</span>, <span class="smcapuc">X</span>, <span class="smcapuc">Z</span> so closely resemble the
same letters in the lower case, that care is required to prevent
intermixing.</p>

<p>In manuscript, small capitals are denoted by <span class="u2">two lines</span>
drawn under the words.</p>

<p>Italic words are designated by a <span class="u">single stroke</span> underneath.</p>

<h4>POINTS.</h4>

<p><span class="word1-smcap">Points</span> consist of a comma, semicolon, colon, period or
full-point, mark of interrogation, and mark of admiration.
Shortly after the invention of printing, the necessity of
stops or pauses in sentences for the guidance of the reader
produced the colon and full-point. In process of time, the
comma was added, which was then merely a perpendicular
line, proportioned to the body of the letter. These three points
were the only ones used till the close of the fifteenth century,
when Aldo Manuccio gave a better shape to the comma, and
added the semicolon; the comma denoting the shortest pause,
the semicolon next, then the colon, and the full-point terminating
the sentence. The marks of interrogation and admiration
were introduced many years after.</p>

<p>Perhaps there never existed on any subject a greater difference
of opinion among men of learning than on the true
mode of punctuation. Some sprinkle the page with commas
almost as promiscuously as if from a pepper-box, and make
the pause of a semicolon where the sense will bear only a
comma; while others are extremely careless, and omit points
even when they are needed to give the true sense of a passage
at the first reading.</p>

<p>The lack of an established practice is much to be regretted.
The loss of time to a compositor occasioned by altering points
arbitrarily is a great hardship. Manuscripts are often placed
in the printer’s hands without being properly prepared: either
the writing is illegible, the spelling incorrect, or the punctuation
defective. Unless the author will take entirely on himself
the responsibility of the pointing, it will be better to omit
every point in the copy, except at the end of a sentence, rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
than confuse the mind of the compositor by commas and
semicolons placed indiscriminately, in the hurry of writing,
without any regard to propriety.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Comma</span> [,] divides the clauses of a long or involved
sentence, and commonly marks the shortest pause in reading.</p>

<p>Commas are used to denote extracts or quotations from
other works, dialogue matter, or passages or expressions not
original, by placing two of them inverted before the first word
of the passage quoted, the ending being denoted by two apostrophes.
A thin space is used to keep the inverted commas
free from the matter. The method of running them down the
sides to the end of the quotation has been found inconvenient,
especially where a quotation occurs within a quotation, or a
speech within a speech: the proper method of distinguishing
these is by placing a single inverted comma before the extra
quotation, and concluding with a single apostrophe. Where
both quotations end together, put three apostrophes, observing
after the first to place a thin space.</p>

<p>Inverted commas were first used by Guillemet, a Frenchman,
to supersede the use of Italic letter in emphasized
words. As an acknowledgment, his countrymen call them
after his name. French founders cast them double, thus [«»].
MacKellar, Smiths &amp; Jordan, Philadelphia, furnish them in
this way when desired.</p>

<p>A single comma inverted is improperly used as an abbreviation
of the word Mac, as in M’Gowen: c is preferable, as
McGowen.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Semicolon</span> [;] denotes a pause greater than that of a
comma, and is used between dependent clauses of compound
sentences.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Colon</span> [:] is employed in a sentence between clauses
less connected than those which are divided by a semicolon,
but not so independent as separate, distinct sentences.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Period</span> or <span class="smcap">Full-Point</span> [.] serves to indicate the end
of a complete sentence. When used in abbreviations, it has
no effect as a full stop in the punctuation, unless at the end of
a sentence. In some works this point is discarded as a mark
of abbreviation, as in Mr Dr &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Full-points are sometimes used as leaders in tables of contents,
figure-work, &amp;c.; but dotted rules or leaders are more
economical for this purpose, as they save considerable time
in the composition.</p>

<p>The sign of <span class="smcap">Interrogation</span> [?] is used to denote a question.
Every interrogation or question should begin with a
capital letter, (unless several questions follow one another in
connected succession,) according to the method observed in
the Bible, where questions and responses, and the beginning
of sayings, &amp;c. are denoted by a capital letter.</p>

<p>The sign of <span class="smcap">Admiration</span> or <span class="smcap">Exclamation</span> [!] denotes
surprise, astonishment, rapture, and other sudden emotions
of the mind, whether of joy or sorrow. This sign is put after
the interjections Ah! Alas! Oh! &amp;c.; but there are exceptional
cases, as, Ah me! Alas the day! &amp;c.</p>

<p>All the points, except the comma and the period, should be
preceded by a hair-space; the comma and full-point do not
require any space to bear them off.</p>

<p>The em dash [—], though not ranked as a point, is often
used by careless writers as a substitute for a comma or semicolon.
It may be properly employed in parenthetical sentences,
and in rhapsodical writing abounding in disconnected
sentences.</p>

<p>A dash stands for a sign of repetition in catalogues of
goods, where it implies <i>ditto</i>; and in catalogues of books, where
a dash signifies <i lang="la">ejusdem</i>, instead of repeating the author’s
name with the title of every separate treatise of his writing.
A sign of repetition should never appear at the top of a page,
but the name of the author, or of the merchandise, should
be set out again at length.</p>

<p>A dash likewise stands for <i>to</i>; as, chap. xvi. 3-17; that is,
from the third to the seventeenth verse inclusive. At other
times it serves for an index, to give notice that what follows
it is a corollary of what has preceded; thus:—</p>

<h4>APOSTROPHE.</h4>

<p><span class="word1-smcap">The</span> apostrophe [’] is a comma cast on the upper edge of
a type, and is used as a sign of contraction or abbreviation
of words in poetry or familiar conversation, as <i>We’re</i>, <i>o’er</i>,
<i>don’t</i>, &amp;c. In poetry, it should not be employed where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
verb ends with e, as <i>love</i>, <i>change</i>, &amp;c., but only in cases where
the verb concludes with a consonant, as, <i>reign</i>, <i>obtain</i>, &amp;c.
It also marks the elision of a vowel at the beginning of words,
as, <i>’scape</i>, or of a syllable, as, <i>’prentice</i>.</p>

<p>The monosyllables <i>though</i> and <i>through</i> are sometimes
shortened to <i>tho’</i> and <i>thro’</i>, but very improperly, as they retain
the same sound, and the abbreviation cannot in the slightest
degree assist the versification.</p>

<p>Words in the possessive case are generally known by having
<i>’s</i> for their termination.</p>

<p>All quotations which are denoted at the beginning by inverted
commas are closed with apostrophes. There is no
space required between the apostrophe and the matter.</p>

<h4>HYPHEN.</h4>

<p><span class="word1-smcap">A hyphen</span> is a sign of connection, and denotes that the part
of a word at the end of a line belongs to the portion at the
beginning of the next line.</p>

<p>A compositor who studies propriety and neatness in his
work will not allow an unnecessary division, even in a narrow
measure, if he can avoid it by overrunning two or three lines
of matter. In large type and narrow measures, the division
of words cannot be avoided; but care should be taken that
hyphens do not occur at the end of successive lines. In small
type and wide measures, the hyphen may frequently be dispensed
with, either by driving out or getting in the word,
without interfering with the regularity of the spacing. The
compositor who is careful on this point will find his advantage
in the preference given to his work, and in the respect attached
to his character as a master of his business. Numerous divisions
down the side of a page and irregular spacing are the
two greatest defects in composition.</p>

<p>It is proper, if possible, to keep the derivative or radical
word undivided: as, <i>occur-rence</i>, <i>gentle-man</i>, <i>respect-ful</i>, &amp;c.
In other cases, printers generally divide on the vowel, which
is an excellent method.</p>

<p>The hyphen is also used to connect compound words,
which are formed of two substantives, as, <i>bird-cage</i>, <i>love-letter</i>,
&amp;c.; also what are termed compound adjectives, as, <i>well-built</i>
house, <i>handsome-faced</i> child, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>The prepositions <i>after</i>, <i>before</i>, <i>over</i>, &amp;c. are often connected
with other words, but do not always make a proper compound:
thus, <i>before-mentioned</i> is a compound when it precedes
a substantive, as, in the <i>before-mentioned</i> place; but
when it comes after a noun, as, in the place <i>before mentioned</i>,
it should be two distinct words.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<h4>PARENTHESIS AND BRACKET.</h4>

<p><span class="word1-smcap">The</span> use of the <span class="smcap">Parenthesis</span> ( ) is to enclose interpolated
words or sentences which serve to strengthen the argument,
although the main sentence would be complete without the
interpolated matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Parentheses are not as much used as formerly: authors
place their intercalations between commas,—frequently with
a dash at the beginning and ending,—which make them quite
as intelligible as though they were enclosed between parentheses.</p>

<p>Brackets [ ] are seldom made use of, except to indicate
that the word enclosed within them had been carelessly
omitted in the old MS. or copy, and was now inserted by the
editor.</p>

<h4>REFERENCES.</h4>

<p><span class="word1-smcap">References</span> are marks and signs employed to direct the
attention of the reader to notes in the margin or at the bottom
of a page.</p>

<p>The characters technically known by printers as references
are the following, which are used in the order here given:—</p>

<table summary="The reference characters and their names">
  <tr>
    <td>Asterisk</td>
    <td>*</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Dagger</td>
    <td>†</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Double Dagger</td>
    <td>‡</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>Parallel</td>
    <td>∥</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Paragraph</td>
    <td>¶</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>In Roman church-books, the Asterisk divides each verse
of a psalm into two parts, and marks the place where the
responses begin: this in the Book of Common Prayer is denoted
by a colon placed between the two parts of each verse.
Asterisks also denote an omission, or an hiatus in the original
copy; the number of asterisks being multiplied according to
the extent of the omission.</p>

<p>The Dagger, originally termed the Obelisk, or Long Cross,
is frequently used in Roman Catholic church-books, prayers
of exorcism, at the benediction of bread, water, and fruit, and
upon other occasions, where the priest is to make the sign of
the cross; but the square cross (✠) is the proper symbol for
the purpose. The square cross is used, besides, in the pope’s
briefs, and in mandates of archbishops and bishops, immediately
before the signature of their names. It is not placed
among references.</p>

<p>Besides its use as a reference mark, the Paragraph is now
employed chiefly in Bibles, to show the parts into which a
chapter is divided. In Common Prayer Books, paragraphs
are put before the lines that direct the order of the service,
and which are called the Rubrics because they were formerly
printed in red.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>The neatest references, when many are required in books,
are either superior letters or superior figures,—thus, ¹, ², ³, or
thus, ᵃ, ᵇ, ᶜ. Superior letters are used chiefly in Bibles and
other books which have more than one sort of notes, and therefore
require different references. When thus used, the letter ʲ
should be omitted, as, from its similarity to the ⁱ, the reader
might at times be led into error.</p>

<h4>NUMERAL LETTERS.</h4>

<p><span class="word1-smcap">The</span> Greeks at first employed the letters of the entire
alphabet to express the first twenty-four numbers; but the
system was cumbrous, and they adopted the happy expedient
of dividing their alphabet into three portions, using the
first to symbolize the 9 digits, the second the 9 tens, and the
third the 9 hundreds; and, as their alphabet contained only
twenty-four letters, they invented three additional symbols.
Their list of symbols then stood as follows:—</p>

<p>By these symbols, only numbers under 1000 could be expressed;
but, by putting a mark called iota under any symbol,
its value was increased a thousand-fold: thus, ᾳ = 1000, κͅ =
20,000; or, by subscribing the letter Μ, the value of a symbol
was raised ten thousand-fold. For these two marks, single
and double dots were afterward substituted. This improvement
enabled them to express with facility all numbers as
high as 9,990,000,—a range sufficient for all ordinary purposes.</p>

<p>It has been supposed that the Romans used M to denote
1000 because it is the first letter of Mille, which is Latin for
1000; and C to denote 100, it being the first letter of Centum,
the Latin term for 100. Some also suppose that D, being
formed by dividing the old M in the middle, was therefore
appointed to stand for 500,—that is, half as much as the M
stood for when it was whole; and that L being half a C, was,
for the same reason, used to denominate 50. But the most
natural account of the matter appears to be this:—</p>

<p>The Romans probably put down a single stroke, Ⅰ, for one,
as is still the practice of those who score on a slate, or with
chalk; this stroke they doubled, trebled, and quadrupled, to
express two, three, and four: thus, ⅠⅠ, ⅠⅠⅠ, ⅠⅠⅠⅠ. So far they
could easily number the strokes with a glance of the eye; but
they found that if more were added it would be necessary to
count the strokes one by one: for this reason, when they came
to five, it was expressed by joining two strokes together in an
acute angle, thus, Ⅴ.</p>

<p>After they had made this acute angle, Ⅴ, for five, they then
added single strokes to the number of four, thus, ⅤⅠ, ⅤⅠⅠ,
ⅤⅠⅠⅠ, ⅤⅠⅠⅠ, and then, as the strokes could not be further
multiplied without confusion, they doubled their acute angle by
prolonging the two lines beyond their intersection, thus, Ⅹ, to
denote two fives, or ten. After they had doubled, trebled, and
quadrupled this double acute angle, thus, ⅩⅩ, ⅩⅩⅩ, ⅩⅩⅩⅩ,
they then, for the same reason which induced them to make a
single angle first, and then to double it, joined two single
strokes in another form, and, instead of an acute angle, made
a right angle, Ⅼ, to denote fifty. When this was doubled, they
then doubled the right angle, thus, ⊏, to denote one hundred,
and, having numbered this double right angle four times, thus,
⊏⊏, ⊏⊏⊏, ⊏⊏⊏⊏, when they came to the fifth number, as
before, they reverted it, and put a single stroke before it, thus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Ⅰ⊐, to denote five hundred; and, when this five hundred was
doubled, then they also doubled their double right angle, setting
two double right angles opposite to each other, with a
single stroke between them, thus, ⊏Ⅰ⊐, to denote one thousand:
when this note for one thousand had been repeated four
times, they then put down Ⅰ⊐⊐ for five thousand, ⊏⊏Ⅰ⊐⊐ for
ten thousand, and Ⅰ⊐⊐⊐ for fifty thousand.</p>

<p>The corners of the angles being cut off by transcribers for
despatch, these figures were gradually brought into what are
now called numerical letters. When the corners of ⊏Ⅰ⊐ were
made round, it stood thus, ⅭⅠↃ, which is so near the Gothic
ന that it soon deviated into that character; so that Ⅰ⊐ having
the corners made round stood thus, ⅠↃ, and then easily deviated
into D. ⊏ also became a plain C by the same means:
the single rectangle, which denoted fifty, was, without any
alteration, a capital L; the double acute angle was an X; the
single acute angle, a V; and a plain single stroke, the letter I.
And thus these seven letters, M, D, C, L, X, V, I, became numerals.
As a further proof of this assertion, let it be considered
that ⅭⅠↃ is still used for one thousand, and ⅠↃ for five hundred,
instead of M and D; and this mark, ന, is sometimes used to
denote one thousand, which may easily be derived from this
figure, ⊏Ⅰ⊐, but cannot be deviations from, or corruptions of,
the Roman letter M. The Romans also expressed any number
of thousands by a line drawn over any numeral less than one
thousand: thus, V̅ denotes five thousand, L̅X̅ sixty thousand;
so, likewise, M̅ is one million, M̅M̅ two millions, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Upon the discovery of printing, and before capitals were
invented, small letters served for numerals; not only when
Gothic characters were in vogue, but when Roman had become
the prevailing character. Thus, in early times, <span class="gothic">i</span> <span class="gothic">b</span> <span class="gothic">x</span> <span class="gothic">l</span> <span class="gothic">c</span> <span class="gothic">d</span> <span class="gothic">m</span> were,
and in Roman type are still, of the same signification as capitals
when used as numerals. Though the capital J is not a
numeral letter, yet the lower-case <span class="gothic">j</span> is as often and as significantly
used as the vowel <span class="gothic">i</span>, especially where the former is
employed as a closing letter, in <span class="gothic">ij</span> <span class="gothic">iij</span> <span class="gothic">bj</span> <span class="gothic">bij</span> <span class="gothic">biij</span> <span class="gothic">dcij</span>, &amp;c. In
Roman lower-case numerals, the j is not regarded, but the i
stands for figure 1 wherever it is used numerically.</p>

<p>During the existence of the French Republic, books were
dated in France from the first year of the Republic: thus
An. XII. (1803,) or twelve years from 1792.</p>

<h4>ARITHMETICAL FIGURES.</h4>

<p><span class="word1-smcap">The</span> arithmetical or Arabic numerals are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9. Properly they should be styled Hindu or Indian
numerals; for the Arabs borrowed them, along with the decimal
system of notation, from the Hindus. They were probably
first introduced from the East into Italy about 1202; yet
they did not come into general use before the invention of
printing. Accounts were kept in Roman numerals up to the
sixteenth century. Figures are usually made one en thick;
but of late a broader figure is cast for newspaper use, which
is two-thirds or six-sevenths of an em in width.</p>

<h5>OLD STYLE FIGURES.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> uniform in height and appearance, we do not
deem the modern figures an improvement on the variously-lining
figures formerly in vogue, and now happily coming
again into use. The latter can be caught by the eye with
greater ease and certainty, just as lower-case letter can be
read with more facility than continuous lines of capitals. In
the new style the 3 and 8 may easily be mistaken for each other,
and so with the 6, 9, and 0; but in the old style figures such
errors are quite unlikely to happen, as some of them occupy
the centre of the body only, and others are ascending or descending
characters. The example here given will show the
justice of our remarks:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/numbers.jpg" width="200" height="45" alt="" />
<p class="caption">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0</p>
<p class="caption">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0</p>

<h5>SCRATCHED OR CANCELLED FIGURES</h5>

<p class="center">1̷ 2̷ 3̷ 4̷ 5̷ 6̷ 7̷ 8̷ 9̷ 0̷</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Are</span> used in arithmetical matter when certain figures require
to be crossed over in an operation.</p>

<h5>FRACTIONS.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Common Fractions</span>, or broken numbers in arithmetic, are
cast solid to all sizes of type. A great improvement has been
introduced by casting the numerator and denominator separately,
on bodies of half size, with the line on the under
figure, so that odd fractions of any amount may be readily
formed, thus: ¹ ² ³ ⁄₂ ⁄₃ ⁄₄ ½ ⅔ ¾.</p>

<h5>MATHEMATICAL, ALGEBRAICAL, AND GEOMETRICAL.</h5>

<p>+ <i>plus</i>, or <i>more</i>, is the sign of real existence of the quantity
it stands before, and is called an affirmative or positive sign.
It is also the mark of addition: thus, <i>a</i>+<i>b</i>, or 6+9, implies
that <i>a</i> is to be added to <i>b</i>, or 6 added to 9.</p>

<p>− <i>minus</i>, or <i>less</i>, before a single quantity, is the sign of
negation, or negative existence, showing the quantity to which
it is prefixed to be less than nothing. But between quantities
it is the sign of subtraction: thus, <i>a</i>−<i>b</i>, or 8−4, implies <i>b</i>
subtracted from <i>a</i>, or 8 after 4 has been subtracted.</p>

<p>= <i>equal</i>. The sign of equality, though Des Cartes and
some others use this mark, ∝: thus, <i>a</i>=<i>b</i> signifies that <i>a</i> is
equal to <i>b</i>. Others use the mark = to denote identity of ratios.</p>

<p>× <i>into</i> or <i>with</i>. The sign of multiplication, showing that
the quantities on each side the same are to be multiplied by
one another: as, <i>a</i>×<i>b</i> is to be read, <i>a</i> multiplied into <i>b</i>; 4×8,
the product of 4 multiplied into 8. Wolfius and others use a
dot between the two factors: thus, 7·4 signifies the product
of 7 and 4. In algebra the sign is commonly omitted, and the
two quantities put together: thus, <i>bd</i> expresses the product of
<i>b</i> and <i>d</i>. When one or both of the factors are compounded
of several letters, they are distinguished by a line drawn
over them: thus, the factum of <i>a</i>+<i>b</i>-<i>c</i> into <i>d</i> is written,
<i>d</i> × <i>a̅</i>+̅<i>b̅</i><i>-̅c̅</i>. Others distinguish the compound factors by
including them in parentheses: thus, (<i>a</i>+<i>b</i>-<i>c</i>)<i>d</i>.</p>

<p>÷ <i>by</i>. The sign of division: thus, <i>a</i>÷<i>b</i> denotes the quantity
<i>a</i> to be divided by <i>b</i>. Wolfius makes the sign of division
two dots; 12:4 denotes the quotient of 12 divided by 4 = 3.</p>

<p>&gt; or ⫍ are signs of majority: thus, <i>a</i>&gt;<i>b</i> expresses that <i>a</i> is
greater than <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>&lt; or ⫎ are signs of minority,—when we would denote that
<i>a</i> is less than <i>b</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>∞ is the character of similitude used by Wolfius, Leibnitz,
and others. It is used in other authors for the difference between
two quantities when it is unknown which is the greater
of the two.</p>

<p>∷ <i>so is</i>. The mark of geometrical proportion disjunct, and
is usually placed between two pair of equal ratios: as, 3∶6∷4∶8
shows that 3 is to 6 as 4 is to 8.</p>

<p>∶ or ∴ is an arithmetical equal proportion: as, 7.3∶13.9;
<i>i. e.</i> 7 is more than 3, as 13 is more than 9.</p>

<p>⬜ quadrate, or regular quadrangle,—viz. ⬜AB=⬜BC;
<i>i. e.</i> the quadrangle upon the line AB is equal to the quadrangle
upon the line BC.</p>

<p>△ triangle: as, △ABC=△ADC.</p>

<p>∠ an angle: as, ∠ABC=∠ADC.</p>

<p>⟂ perpendicular: as, AB⟂BC.</p>

<p>▭ rectangled parallelogram, or the product of two lines.</p>

<p>∥ the character of parallelism.</p>

<p>⧧ want of parallelism.</p>

<p>≚ equiangular, or similar.</p>

<p>⫨ equilateral.</p>

<p>▱ rhomboid.</p>

<p>◠ concentrix.</p>

<p>○ circle.</p>

<p>∟ right angle.</p>

<p>∫ integration, (<i lang="la">summa</i> or sum).</p>

<p>° denotes a degree: thus, 45° implies 45 degrees.</p>

<p>´ a minute: thus, 50´ is 50 minutes; ´´, ´´´, ´´´´, denote
seconds, thirds, and fourths; and the same characters are used
where the progressions are by tens, as it is here by sixties.</p>

<p>∺ the mark of geometrical proportion continued, implies
the ratio to be still carried on without interruption: as, 2, 4, 8,
16, 32, 64 ∺ are in the same uninterrupted proportion.</p>

<p>√ When used without a figure above it, indicates the square
root, and is called the radical sign. Any other root is expressed
by the index figure placed above the sign. √16 is the square
root of 16, ∛27 the cube root of 27, &amp;c.</p>

<p>≅ difference equal.</p>

<p>∹ the difference, or excess.</p>

<p>Q or q, a square.</p>

<p>C or c, a cube.</p>

<p>QQ, the ratio of a square number to a square number.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>In algebraical work, authors should be very exact in their
copy, and compositors as careful in following it, so that no
alterations may be necessary after it is composed, the over-running
of this kind of matter being troublesome and costly.</p>

<h4>METAL RULES OR DASHES.</h4>

<p><span class="word1-smcap">Metal Rules</span> or dashes, [⸺] like quadrates, are commonly
cast from one em to three ems in length. When cast
to line and join accurately, they may be used instead of brass
rule.</p>

<h4>BRACES.</h4>

<p><span class="word1-smcap">Braces</span> [⏞] are used chiefly in tables of accounts, botanical
and geological tables, and similar matter. They are
placed before or after a series of items of similar import; and
are sometimes used horizontally in the margin, to cut off a
chronological or other series from the proper notes or marginal
references of the work. Braces, two, three, and four ems
in length, are now cast for all sizes of common type.</p>

<p><i>Middles</i> and <i>ends</i> are also cast, [<img class="symb" src="images/symb-braces-parts.jpg" width="100" height="25" alt="Image showing middles and ends of braces" />] which can be filled
out with dashes to any length required for the brace. Middles
and ends are convenient in genealogical tables, in which they
are used the flat way, and in which the directing point is not
always in the middle.</p>

<p>Brass braces of any length, for music and jobbing purposes,
are furnished by type-founders.</p>

<h4>SPACES.</h4>

<p><span class="word1-smcap">Spaces</span> are short blank types, and are used to separate
one word from another. To enable the compositor to space
even and to justify with nicety, they are cast to various thicknesses,—viz.
five to an em, [<img class="symb" src="images/symb-space-5em.jpg" width="9" height="25" alt="Image showing this thickness of space" />] or five thin spaces; four to an
em, [<img class="symb" src="images/symb-space-4em.jpg" width="13" height="25" alt="Image showing this thickness of space" />] or four middle spaces; three to an em, [<img class="symb" src="images/symb-space-3em.jpg" width="14" height="25" alt="Image showing this thickness of space" />] or three
thick spaces; and two to an em, [<img class="symb" src="images/symb-space-2em.jpg" width="16" height="25" alt="Image showing this thickness of space" />] or two en quadrates,
which may with propriety be reckoned among the number of
spaces. Besides these, there is what is called the hair-space,
which is cast extremely thin, and is found useful in justifying
lines and assisting uniformity in spacing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<h4>TWO-LINE LETTERS</h4>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Are</span> equal in depth to two lines of the type in which they
are to be used, and of proportionate width. They form
the almost only proper type for principal lines in title-pages,
and are used at the beginning of chapters and newspaper
advertisements.</p>

<h4>QUADRATES.</h4>

<p><span class="word1-smcap">An</span> em quadrate [■] is a short blank type, in thickness
equal to the square of the letter of the fount to which it belongs;
an en quadrate [▮] is half that size.</p>

<p>The first line of a paragraph is usually indented an em quadrate;
but when the matter is leaded or the measure is wide,
an em and en, or two or even three ems may be used. An em
quadrate is the proper space after a full-point when it terminates
a sentence in a paragraph.</p>

<p>En quadrates are generally used after the semicolon, colon,
&amp;c., and sometimes after an overhanging letter. They are
useful in spacing.</p>

<p>Em and en quadrates, and figures as well, should be entirely
exact and uniform in body, as even a trifling variation
will be apparent when they are arranged in table or figure-work;
and no ingenuity on the part of a compositor can
rectify the zigzag appearance caused by irregular types.</p>

<p>The inconvenience arising from founts of the same body
not agreeing in depth is great, where the quadrates, through
necessity, are sometimes mixed. The founts cast by MacKellar,
Smiths &amp; Jordan are not liable to this charge, as their moulds
for all regular type of a specific size harmonize perfectly, and
the quadrates and spaces work together.</p>

<h4>QUOTATIONS.</h4>

<p><span class="word1-smcap">Quotations</span> are large blank type used for filling up considerable
spaces at the beginning or end of a chapter, and
also for job-work. They are cast to two sizes, and are called
broad and narrow. They vary in size according to the standard
of the foundry where they are cast. They are being superseded,
however, by</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is cast with great accuracy to Pica, of assorted widths

quotations in general job-work, but also for furniture.</p>

<h5>STANDARD METAL FURNITURE.</h5>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

<p><span class="smcap">Owing</span> to the large assortment of sizes contained in this
furniture, it is useful for blanking out all varieties of work,
from the card or circular to the large hand-bill or poster. As
the above metal furnitures are not liable to warp or shrink,
they form a highly economical substitute for wooden reglet.</p>

<h5>HOLLOW QUADRATES</h5>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/quadrate-hollow.jpg" width="200" height="120" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Answer</span> many of the purposes of quotations, but are principally
useful as frames or miniature chases for circular or oval
jobs. The sizes are graduated from 5 × 8 to 12 × 18 Pica ems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<h5>CIRCULAR QUADRATES.</h5>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/quadrate-circular.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> are made of various sizes, so as to form circles or
parts of circles from one to twenty-four inches in diameter.
Each piece is exactly one-eighth of a full circle, and, when
combined with similar pieces, will form quarter, half, three-quarter,
and full circles. By reversing the combination of some
of the pieces, serpentine and eccentric curves may be made of
any length or depth.</p>

<p>There are two kinds: <i>inner quadrates</i>, with convex surface,
and <i>outer quadrates</i>, with concave surface. The curved line is
produced by placing the convex and concave surfaces parallel
to each other, so that when locked up firmly they hold the
type inserted between them. The other sides of the quadrates
are flat and right-angled, to allow a close introduction of type,
and an easy justification with common quadrates.</p>

<p>As these quadrates are perfect segments of a large circle,
they cannot be increased or diminished without destroying the
truth of the curve. If the thin ends are pieced out with common
quadrates, good justification will be rendered impossible;
if they are shortened by cutting off, they are ruined. Bits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
lead or short pieces of card between the curved surfaces are
also wrong: they destroy that exact parallelism which is
necessary for the security of the type. Very accurate justification
of the outer extremities of the quadrates is also indispensable.
If the curved surfaces are kept parallel, and the
flat surfaces kept square, no difficulty will be found in using
them, and they will prove a valuable aid in ornamental printing.</p>

printers.</p>

<h3>LEADS.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Leads</span> form an essential part of a printer’s outfit, since it is
scarcely possible to set up a single page or job in which
they may not be usefully employed; but their chief purpose is
for spreading the lines apart so as to reduce the amount of matter
in a page. Fine works are always thus leaded. They are
usually cast by letter-founders in a long mould, and then cut
to the required lengths. The bodies are regulated by Pica
standard, and they are usually cast four, six, or eight to Pica,
but are occasionally varied from one down to fourteen to Pica.
Leads for jobbing purposes are now cut to graduated lengths,
like labour-saving rule.</p>

<h3>FLOWERS AND BORDERS.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">The</span> flowers and borders designed and cast at the present
time far surpass any made by founders of earlier days.
Their richness and variety enable printers to execute delicate
and elaborate work, rivalling plate engraving, and afford a wide
scope for the display of taste and artistic skill. The combination
borders are especially valuable from being cast on
uniform bodies, thus rendering them susceptible of a vast
number of changes.</p>

<p>The ancient practice of ornamenting pages with head and
tail pieces of flowers and odd designs seems to be coming
in vogue again, particularly in works printed in the old-style
type.</p>

<h3>BRASS RULES.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Rules</span> are required mainly for table-work, and for pages
which contain two or more columns. They are also useful
in titles and jobs. Brass rules should never be more than type
height, unless for perforating purposes, to divide railroad
checks, &amp;c. A shade lower would be often better, as the
pressman would be enabled to bring off their impression
more clearly. In table-work, the rule and figures should be
separated by a lead, and all the rules should fit closely and
accurately.</p>

<p>The lately-invented</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p class="center bold">BRASS LABOUR-SAVING RULE</p>

<p class="noindent">is of immense economical advantage to the printer. Being
cut to a graduated scale, from one em to fifty ems Pica in length,
advancing in the shorter pieces by ens and in the longer by
ems, all waste in cutting is avoided by the printer, as rules of
any length can be formed by employing two or more pieces.
This rule is put up in regular founts, of various styles, with
sufficient mitred pieces for outside bordering.</p>

<h3>EARLIEST WRITTEN SOUNDS.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">The</span> hieroglyphic is the most ancient form of written
sounds. The earliest known monuments containing phonetic
hieroglyphics date about forty centuries ago, or six hundred
years before the time of Moses, who is supposed to have
been versed in the knowledge of the hieroglyphs. Yet nothing
worthy of the name of an alphabet existed till a later period,
when the Phœnicians invented a purely alphabetic system,
but suppressing the vowels, and from this has originated all
the modes of alphabetic writing now used.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The Greeks
introduced the vowels into their graphic system, and so
brought to perfection the invaluable invention of alphabetic
writing.</p>

<p>The discovery of the Rosetta stone furnished a clue to the
method of deciphering the Egyptian hieroglyphics; and Dr.
Young and Champollion were the first to make use of the
suggestive opportunity. The words <i>Ptolemy</i> and <i>Cleopatra</i>
were made out; and these served as a key or incentive to further
investigations; and extensive and curious volumes have
been devoted to the interpretation of Egypt’s mysterious inscriptions
on monuments and writings on papyrus.</p>

<p>Among those who have investigated the Egyptian hieroglyphs,
Mr. R. Lepsius is one of the most practical, for he has
reduced the ancient characters to typographical uses for the
behoof of the delvers into the earth’s earliest lore. He began
the work soon after his return from a scientific expedition to
Egypt during the years 1842-46, and his hieroglyphic types
now completed number more than thirteen hundred. The
Prussian government furnishing the needful pecuniary means,
his first task was to ascertain the forms of hieroglyphic signs
which would be most suitable for typographical purposes, and
here the labour was immense. After laborious research, he
reached the conclusion, that as European print had been
formed, not from the monumental characters of the Greeks
and Romans, but essentially from the current handwriting of
documents on parchment and paper, so the hieroglyphic type
should follow, not the chiseled or painted characters on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
monuments, but the style of those written on papyrus. The
style and proportions having been established, the punch-cutting
was mostly executed by Mr. Ferdinand Theinhardt,
the excellent Prussian type-founder, who for a series of years
has been skilfully engaged in producing the matrices. We are
indebted to Mr. Theinhardt for the specimens here given; the
first of which is the hieroglyphic alphabet, and the second is
the beginning of an ancient text found in a leather roll of the
Royal Museum of Berlin, referring to the foundation of the
temple of the Sun at On or Heliopolis in Egypt.</p>

<h3>RUNIC ALPHABETS.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Runes</span> were the earliest alphabets in use among the Teutonic
and Gothic nations of Northern Europe. The exact
period of their origin is not known. The name is derived
from the Teutonic <i>rûn</i>, a mystery; whence <i>runa</i>, a whisper,
and <i>helrûn</i>, divination; and the original use of these characters
seems to have been for purposes of secrecy and divination.
Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon tradition agree in ascribing the
invention of runic writing to Odin or Wodin. The countries
in which traces of the use of runes exist include Denmark,
Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Germany, Britain, France, and
Spain; and they are found engraved on rocks, crosses, monumental
stones, coins, medals, rings, brooches, and the hilts and
blades of swords. Runic letters were also often cut on smooth
sticks called <i>rûn-stafas</i>, or mysterious staves, and used for
purposes of divination. But there is no reason to believe that
they were at any time in the familiar use in which we find the
characters of a written language in modern times, nor have
we any traces of their being used in books or on parchment.
We have an explanation of the runic alphabet in various MSS.
of the early middle ages, prior to the time when runes had
altogether ceased to be understood.</p>

<p>The systems of runes in use among the different branches
of the Teutonic stock were not identical, though they have a
strong general family likeness, showing their community of
origin. The letters are arranged in an order altogether distinct
from that of any other alphabetical system, and have a purely
Teutonic nomenclature. Each letter is, as in the Hebrew-Phœnician,
derived from the name of some well-known familiar
object, with whose initial letter it corresponds. Runes, being
associated in the popular belief with augury and divination,
were to a considerable extent discouraged by the early Christian
priests and missionaries, whose efforts were directed to the
supplanting of them by Greek and Roman characters. But it
was not easy suddenly to put a stop to their use, and we find
runes continuing to be employed in early Christian inscriptions.
This was to a remarkable extent the case in the Anglo-Saxon
kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia, and East Anglia, where we
have traces of runic writing of dates varying from the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of the seventh to the middle of the tenth century. Runes are
said to have been laid aside in Sweden by the year 1001, and
in Spain they were officially condemned by the Council of
Toledo in 1115.</p>

<p>The different systems of runes, all accordant up to a certain
point, have been classed as the Anglo-Saxon, the German, and
the Norse, each containing different subordinate varieties.
The Norse alphabet is generally considered the oldest, and the
parent of the rest. It has sixteen letters corresponding to our
<i>f</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>th</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>y</i>, but has no equivalent
for various sounds which exist in the language, in consequence
of which the sound of <i>k</i> was used for <i>g</i>, <i>d</i> for <i>t</i>, <i>b</i> for <i>p</i>, and <i>u</i>
and <i>y</i> for <i>v</i>: <i>o</i> was expressed by <i>au</i>, and <i>e</i>, by <i>ai</i>, <i>i</i>, or <i>ia</i>; and
the same letter otherwise was made to serve for more than one
sound. Other expedients came, in the course of time, to be
employed to obviate the deficiency of the system,—as the addition
of dots, and the adoption of new characters. But the runic
system received a fuller development among the Germans and
Anglo-Saxons, particularly the latter, whose alphabet was extended
to no fewer than forty characters, in which seem to
have been embraced, more nearly than in any modern alphabets,
the actual sounds of a language. The table on the following
page exhibits the best known forms of the Anglo-Saxon,
German, and Norse runic alphabets, with the names
and the power of the several letters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/type-runes-1.jpg" width="700" height="460" alt="Runic alphabets" />
</div>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon runes, as here given, are derived from a
variety of MS. authorities, the most complete containing forty
characters, while some only extend as far as the twenty-fifth or
twenty-eighth letter. Neither the name nor the power of some
of the later letters is thoroughly known, and they are without
any equivalents in the Norse runic system. The German
runes are given from a MS. in the conventual library of St. Gall,
in Switzerland. Though the various runic alphabets are not
alike copious, the same order of succession among the letters
is preserved, excepting that, in the Norse alphabet, <i>laugr</i> precedes
<i>madr</i>, although we have placed them otherwise, with
the view of exhibiting the correspondence of the three systems.
The number of characters in the Anglo-Saxon alphabet is a
multiple of the sacred number eight; and we have the evidence
both of a Swedish bracteate containing twenty-four characters,
and of the above mentioned St. Gall MS., that there was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>recognized division of the alphabet into classes of eight letters,—a
classification which forms the basis of a system of secret
runes, mentioned in that MS. Of these secret runes, there are
several varieties specified: in particular, 1. <i>Iis-runa</i> and <i>Lago-runa</i>
(of which specimens exist in Scandinavia), consisting of
groups of repetitions of the character <i>iis</i> or <i>lago</i>, some shorter
and some longer, the number of shorter characters in each
group denoting the class to which the letter intended to be
indicated belonged; the number of longer ones, its position
in the class. 2. <i>Hahal-runa</i>, where the letters are indicated
by characters with branching stems, the branches to the left
denoting the class, and those to the right the position in that
class. There is an inscription in secret runes of this description
at Hackness, in Yorkshire. 3. <i>Stof-runa</i>, in which the
class is indicated by points placed above, and the position in
the class by points below, or the reverse.</p>

<p>The best-known inscriptions in the Anglo-Saxon character
are those on two grave-stones at Hartlepool, in Northumberland,
on a cross at Bewcastle, in Cumberland, and on another
cross at Ruthwell, in Dumfriesshire. The inscription on the
west side of Bewcastle cross, which we give as a specimen of
Anglo-Saxon runes, is a memorial of Alcfrid, son of Oswiu,
who was associated with his father in the government of the
kingdom of Northumbria, in the seventh century.</p>

puzzle to antiquaries, was first deciphered in 1838 by Mr. John
M. Kemble, an eminent Anglo-Saxon scholar. It is written
alternately down one side of the stone and up another, and contains
a portion of a poem on the subject of the Crucifixion.
Mr. Kemble’s interpretation received a very satisfactory confirmation
by the discovery of a more complete copy of the same
poem in a MS. volume of Anglo-Saxon homilies at Vercelli.</p>

<p>Mr. D. M. Haigh, whose researches have added much to our
knowledge of Anglo-Saxon runes, has endeavoured to set up
for them a claim of priority over the Norse characters. Instead
of considering the additional Anglo-Saxon letters as a development
of the Norse system, he looks on the Norse alphabet
of sixteen letters as an abridgment of an earlier system,
and finds occasional traces of the existence of the discarded
characters in the earliest Norse inscriptions, and in the Scandinavian
<i>Iis-runa</i> and <i>Hahal-runa</i>, where the letters are classified
in accordance with the Anglo-Saxon groups of eight.</p>

<p>The Scandinavian kingdoms contain numerous runic monuments,
some of them written <i>boustrophedon</i>, or with the lines
beginning alternately from the right and left; and there are
many interesting inscriptions on Swedish gold bracteates. The
Celtic races, from their connection with the Scandinavians,
became acquainted with their alphabet, and made use of it in
writing their own language; and hence we have, in the Western
Islands of Scotland and in the Isle of Man, runic inscriptions,
not in the Anglo-Saxon, but in the Norse character, with, however,
a few peculiarities of their own. Some of the most
perfect runic inscriptions are in Man; others of similar description
exist at Holy Island, in Lamlash Bay, Arran; and there
is an inscription in the same character on a remarkable brooch
dug up at Hunterston, in Ayrshire. Dr. D. Wilson considers
that the Celtic population of Scotland were as familiar with
Norse as the Northumbrians with Saxon runes.</p>

<p>We sometimes find the Norse runes used to denote numerals,
in which case the sixteen characters stand for the numbers
from 1 to 16; <i>ar</i> combined with <i>laugr</i> stands for 17, double
<i>madr</i> for 18, and double <i>tyr</i> for 19. Two more letters are used
to express higher numbers, as <i>ur ur</i>, 20; <i>thurs thurs os</i>, 34.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<h3>ANGLO-SAXON ALPHABET.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">The</span> Anglo-Saxon alphabet, and the forms and sounds of
the letters, are shown in the following table:—</p>

</div>

<p>Two useful Anglo-Saxon letters have disappeared from
modern English,—namely, Þ or þ th (<em>th</em>in), and Ð or ð th (<em>th</em>ine).</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon letters which vary from those now used
were doubtless mere corruptions of the Roman forms,—viz.
the capitals A, C, E, G, H, M, S, and W, and the small letters
d, f, g, i, r, s, t, and w. Several marks of abbreviation were
used by the Saxons, as ꝥ <i>that</i>, ⁊ <i>and</i>, &amp;c. These were not
original members of the alphabet, but were introduced probably
for despatch.</p>

<p>About the year 1567, John Daye, who was patronized by
Archbishop Parker, cut the first Saxon types which were used
in England. In this year, <cite>Asserius Menevensis</cite> was published
by the direction of the archbishop in these characters; in the
same year, Archbishop Ælfric’s <cite>Paschal Homily</cite>; and in 1571,
the <cite>Saxon Gospels</cite>.</p>

<p>On the two following pages will be found a plan of cases
for Saxon types.</p>

<p>From a desire, probably, to imitate Greek manuscript, a
multitude of ligatures, abbreviations, and contractions of
letters, as well as duplicates, were cast by the early type-founders.
These, however, with two or three exceptions, have
been quite discarded; and a fount of modern Greek is readily
accommodated in a single pair of cases. The only duplicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
characters in the preceding table are β and ϐ, ϑ and Θ, and σ
and ς. β looks best when used as an initial letter, and ϐ as a
medial. ϑ and Θ are used indiscriminately; but ς is employed
as a final letter only.</p>

<p>There are twelve diphthongs or compound vowels in Greek,
viz.:—</p>

<p>Six proper,—αι, αυ, ει, ευ, οι, ου; and</p>

<p>Six improper,—ᾳ, ῃ, ῳ, ηυ, υι, ωυ. The point under the first
three letters denotes the iota, and is therefore called the <i>subscript
iota</i>.</p>

<p>Accents are nothing more than small marks which have
been introduced into the language to denote the pronunciation
of words, and aid its acquisition by learners. The ancient
Greeks never used them, as is demonstrated from Aristotle,
old inscriptions, and ancient medals. It is not easy to tell
the date when the practice of writing with accents first obtained,
though it is probable not till after the Romans began
to learn the Greek tongue and to send their children to study
at Athens,—that is, about or a little before the time of Cicero.</p>

<p>Accents—by the Greeks called τόνοι, tones—show the rising
or falling of the voice in pronouncing; either separately in distinct
syllables, or conjunctively in the same syllable.</p>

<p>Wherefore there are two sorts of accents: two simple, viz.
the acute, ὀξύς, figured thus [´], which denotes the elevation
of the voice; and the grave, βαρὺς, shaped thus [`], to signify
the falling or depression of the voice: and the circumflex,
περισπώμενος which was formed first of these two lines or points
joined together thus [῍] and afterward was changed into a
round sort of a figure like an inverted upsilon, thus [<img class="symb" src="images/symb-greek-accent.jpg" width="25" height="25" alt="Image showing old form of the circumflex accent" />], but at
length came to be figured like an s drawn crosswise [῀].<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p class="mt15">The acute accent raises the voice, and affects one or more
of the last three syllables of a word, if it has so many.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt15">The grave depresses the voice, and affects the last syllable
only.</p>

<p class="mt15">The circumflex lengthens the sound, and affects either the
last syllable of a word or the last but one.</p>

<p class="mt15">There are two spirits, or breathings: the asper [῾], which
is equivalent to the modern letter h; and the lenis [᾿], which
has no perceptible power, and indicates the bare opening of
the mouth and simple emission of the voice.</p>

<p>All the words that begin with a vowel have one of these
breathings over them; but the vowel upsilon admits of no
other than the <i lang="la">spiritus asper</i> at the beginning of a word.</p>

<p>In diphthongs the <i lang="la">spiritus</i> is put over the second vowel: as
αὐτὸς, not ἀυτὸς.</p>

<p>The letter ρ, at the beginning of a word, has an <i lang="la">asper</i> over
it, as, ῥέω; and where two ρs meet in a word, the first has a
<i lang="la">lenis</i>, and the other an <i lang="la">asper</i>.</p>

<p class="mt15">The apostrophe [’] is used for cutting off the vowels α, ε, ι, ο,
and the diphthongs αι and οι, when they stand at the end of a
word and the next word begins with a vowel: as, παρ’ αὐτῷ for
παρὰ αὐτῷ; πάντ’ ἔλεγον for πάντα ἔλεγον.</p>

<p>Sometimes the apostrophe contracts two words into one:
as, κᾳ’γὼ for καὶ ἐγὼ; ἐγῶ’μαι for ἐγῶ οἴμαι; κᾳ’κεῖνος for καὶ
ἐκεῖνος.</p>

<p>Sometimes an apostrophe supplies the place of the first
vowel beginning a word: as ὦ ’γαθὲ for ὦ ἀγαθὲ; ποῦ ’ςι for ποῦ
ἐςι. This is chiefly used in poetry.</p>

<p>But the prepositions περὶ and πρὸ suffer no apostrophe though
the next word begin with a vowel; for we write περὶ υμῶν, πρὸ
ἐμοῦ; περὶ αὐτον, πρὸ ἐτῶν, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="mt15">The diæresis [¨] is put over the last one of two vowels
that come together, to show that they must be pronounced
separately, and not as a diphthong: thus, ἀϋτὴ with a diæresis
makes three syllables; but without a diæresis αυ is a diphthong,
and makes αὐτὴ two syllables.</p>

<p class="mt15">Diastole [,] is put between two particles that would bear
a different sense without it: thus, ὄ,τε ὄ,τι signify <em>whatever</em>;
whereas ὁτε stands for <em>as</em>, and ὁτι for <em>that</em>. Τό,τε with a diastole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
implies <em>and this</em>; but when without, it answers to the adverb
<em>then</em>.</p>

<p class="mt15">The sign of interrogation, in Greek, is made by a semicolon
[;].</p>

<p>The colon is made by an inverted full-point [·].</p>

<p>All other points are the same as in English.</p>

<p class="mt15">The compositor will find it advantageous to bear in mind
the following rules:—</p>

<p>1. No accent can be placed over any other than one of the
last three syllables of a word.</p>

<p>2. The grave accent never occurs but on the last syllable;
and, this being the case, the asper grave ῝ and lenis grave
῍ can be wanted only for a few monosyllables.</p>

<p>3. No vowel can have a spirit, or breathing, except at the
beginning of a word.</p>

<p>4. The letter ρ is the only consonant marked by a breathing.</p>

<p>5. Almost every word has an accent, but very seldom has
more than one; and, when this happens, it is an acute thrown
back upon the last syllable from one of those words called
enclitics (<i>leaning back</i>), which in that case has none, unless it
be followed by another enclitic. In no other case than this
can a last syllable have an acute accent, except before a full-point,
colon, or note of interrogation, when the grave accent
of the last syllable is changed to an acute,—a circumstance
which has often led printers, who were ignorant of the reasons
for accenting the same word differently in different situations,
to think that there was an error in their copy, and thus
to make one in their proof. Most errors, however, proceed
from those who do not think at all about the matter.</p>

to turn the line and set the points that come under the letters.

under it; but where the letter has two legs, it is put under the
centre.</p>

<p>г, х, е, л, щ, ъ, ы, ь, ѣ, я, о, й, are the only letters whose pronunciation
offers any difficulty.</p>

<p>Г has a sound nearly like <i>g</i> in the English word <i>goose</i>, as in
гру́ша, a <i>pear</i>; read <i>groòshah</i>. But it has a guttural sound
not found in English, and which nearly resembles that of the
German <span class="gothic">ch</span>. This sound is especially perceivable in the middle
of a word when the г is followed by a consonant, also at the
end of a word, as in но́гти, <i>the nails</i>; read <i>nò<span class="gothic">ch</span>tee</i>. In inflections
аго, яго, ого, его, of adjectives and pronouns, the letter г is
pronounced as <i>v</i>; as in кра́снаго, <i>of beautiful</i>; read <i>kràsnavah</i>.</p>

<p>Е has three different sounds: 1. In Russian words, and in
all syllables in which it is preceded by a vowel, <i>е</i> has a sound
like that of <i>yai</i>, when the <i>y</i> is nearly sunk in the pronunciation,
as in ему́, <i>to him</i>; read <i>yaimoò</i>. 2. At the beginning of words
from foreign languages, and at the middle and end of a word
when preceded by a consonant, it has the sound of <i>e</i> in <i>met</i>,
as in берегу́, <i>I guard</i>; read <i>bayregoò</i>. 3. In the termination
екъ of diminutives, in all the characteristic inflections of cases
in the nouns, and of persons in the verbs, in fact, in almost all
words, this letter when accented has a sound nearly like that
of short <i>yo</i> or <i>o</i>; as in куле́къ, <i>a little sack</i>; веде́шь, <i>thou
leadest</i>; медъ, <i>the honey</i>; read <i>koolyòk</i>, <i>vaidyòsh</i>, <i>myod</i>. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
sound <i>yo</i> or <i>o</i> of the letter <i>е</i> is commonly distinguished by a
diæresis over the vowel, as кулёкъ, ведёшь, мёлъ.</p>

<p>Л has a guttural sound nearly analogous to the English <i>w</i>.
Писарлъ, <i>he wrote</i>, read <i>pisaw</i> or <i>pisou</i>.</p>

<p>Ль has a soft sound, as in the French word <i>bouillon</i>.</p>

<p>Х corresponds to the German <span class="gothic">ch</span>. It is a strong aspiration
that nearly resembles the sound <i>k</i> when pronounced hastily
from the throat; as in хвала́, <i>the praise</i>; read <i>khvahlàh</i>.</p>

<p>Щ unites the sound of ш and ч, as in щитъ, <i>the shield</i>; read
<i>shtcheet</i>.</p>

<p>Ъ. This letter has no sound; the preceding consonant, the
last letter of the word, ought to be pronounced a little hollow,
as in боо́ъ, <i>a bean</i>; read <i>bop</i>.</p>

<p>Ы has a sound nearly like <i>we</i> when the <i>w</i> is pronounced
rapidly; as in бу́квьшы, <i>the letters</i>, read <i>boòkwe</i>. It has this sound
after the consonants б, в, м, п, ф; but after another consonant
it is a thick <i>e</i>, as in сынъ, <i>the son</i>; read <i>seen</i>.</p>

<p>Ь. This letter at the end of a word has a sound nearly like
that of the very short <i>e</i>. When followed by a consonant in
the middle of a word it is mute, but is pronounced when
followed by a vowel; as in знатъ, <i>to know</i>; read <i>znaht</i>.</p>

<p>Ѣ at the beginning of a word has the sound of <i>yai</i>; as in
Ѣсть, <i>to eat</i>; read <i>yaist</i>. In the middle of a word it is pronounced
<i>yai</i>, the sound of <i>y</i> being almost sunk; as in нѣтъ,
<i>no</i>; read <i>nyaitt</i>. At the end of a word it is sounded <i>ay</i>.</p>

<p>Я when accented has the sound of the diphthong <i>yah</i>; as in
я́ма, <i>a pit</i>; read <i>yàhmah</i>. But if not accented it is pronounced
<i>yai</i>, as in ядро́, <i>a ball</i>; read <i>yaidrò</i>. The pronoun ея́, <i>of her</i>,
is pronounced <i>yaiyò</i>, and the syllable ся of pronominal verbs
is pronounced <i>sah</i>, as in стара́ться, <i>to exert one’s self</i>; read
<i>stahràhtsah</i>.</p>

<p>О is pronounced as English <i>o</i>; but if unaccented it takes
the sound of <i>ah</i>, as in ко́локолъ, <i>a bell</i>; колокола́, <i>bells</i>; read
<i>kòlahkall</i>, <i>kahlakahlà</i>.</p>

<p>Й is a short <i>e</i>, pronounced very rapidly, as in дай, <i>give</i>;
read <i>dàï</i> or <i>die</i>, giving utterance to a short <i>e</i> after the vowel.</p>

<p>In general the pronunciation of Russian words depends
especially upon the tonic accent, which is no longer printed
in Russian books, except to distinguish some homonymous
words, or some grammatical inflections of similar forms; as
за́мокъ, <i>a castle</i>, and замо́къ, <i>a lock</i>; read <i>zàhmok</i> and <i>zahmòk</i>.</p>

<h3>MUSIC TYPE.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">In</span> no department of letter-founding has the progress of
improvement been more decided and satisfactory than in
the production of music type. The finest work of the music-stamper
cannot surpass the ingenious combinations of the
type-founder and printer. The music of which specimens are
here given is cast on the centre of the body, and any intelligent
workman may learn to compose it with facility. Brass
lines are now furnished with founts when desired.</p>

<h3>MUSIC COMPOSITION.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">A knowledge</span> of the rudiments of the art of music is
essential to the correct composition of music type; for,
unless the compositor is acquainted with the relative time-values
of the notes and rests, he cannot space them properly.</p>

<p>The manuscript copy is given to the compositor, with directions
regarding the dimensions of the page required and the
size of type to be employed. He counts the number of measures
in the piece, and allots to each measure the amount of
ems in length which the page will permit, so that there shall
be a general equality of space throughout the piece.</p>

<p>In instrumental music, and in pieces which are not interlined
with poetry, the compositor will set two or more staves simultaneously,
ranging the leading notes in the lower staves precisely
under the corresponding ones in the upper staff; that is,
a certain amount of space in each staff, in a brace, must contain
the same amount of time-value. Where lines of poetry are
interspersed, as in ballads and in church music, the staves
are necessarily set singly; and in composing the second, third,
and fourth staves the workman must therefore constantly
refer to the first, in order to make the staves correspond.</p>

<p>A good compositor will be careful to make the lines overlap
each other, brick-wise, and not allow a joint to fall directly
under another. Masters who aim to do cheap rather than good
work have the music lines cast double or triple, to expedite
composition. Such work has a very slovenly look, as the joints
of the lines, coming under one another, are apparent in the
entire depth of the staff. We have seen books set in this
manner, in which all the lines seem to be composed of dotted
rule, instead of a continuous stroke.</p>

<p>The compositor should be careful to make the stems of all
the notes in a page of the same length, except those of grace-notes,
which should be about half as long.</p>

<h3>PLAN OF CASES.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">The</span> following plan of cases was arranged by the music
typographer, J. M. Armstrong of Philadelphia, expressly

<h3>MODERN CONVENIENCES.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">At</span> no time since the invention of their art have printers
been so fully supplied as at present with typographic
implements for producing exact and beautiful work. In height
of body, harmony and style of face, and excellence of material,
modern type is doubtless superior to any heretofore made;
but the most striking progression of type-founding is in the
beauty and variety of ornamental letters and borders, and in
these the American founders have taken the lead. A glance
at their late Specimen Books proves the truth of this assertion.
Among late novelties produced by <span class="smcap">The MacKellar,
Smiths &amp; Jordan Co.</span> are several beautiful series of
ingenious adjustable characters for the ornamentation of display
lines, both straight and elliptical. A specimen is given
below. Other appliances for job-printing are noted on <a href="#Page_300">pages

skilful, and capable man, as unmistakably
as the perverse, idling, careless boy will
ripen into a lazy, dissolute, and worthless
fellow. The fact is, a boy is measurably the
maker of his own destiny; and if he fails to
acquire a master-knowledge of the trade to
which he is put, it will mainly be because he did not at his
outset determine to be a master-workman. Good morals and
steady industry are indispensable.</p>

<p>When a lad who possesses these qualities proposes to learn
the art and mystery of printing, it should be inquired of him,
Has he had a fair common-school education? Is he a perfect
speller? Has he a turn for reading? Is his eyesight good?
Is he under fifteen years of age? A true affirmative answer to
all these queries will entitle him to the position of reading
and errand-boy. He is told the hours at which he is to come
and go, and a strict punctuality is enjoined upon him. He
sweeps the room,—he sorts out the pi,—he learns the position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of the various letters in the case. A year spent in this way is
an excellent preparative for “going to case,” or learning the
art of composing type.</p>

<p>When he is put to composition, he is told to set up one line
and show it to the foreman or to the journeyman under whose
care he may be placed. The errors in the line are pointed out
to him, and he is required to correct them himself. When the
words are perfectly correct, he justifies the line tight enough
to prevent it from falling down when the composing-stick is
slightly inclined, and yet sufficiently loose to enable him to
lift it out with ease. In thus spacing out the line, the blanks
between the words must be so graduated that, when the matter
is printed, all the words will appear at equal distances apart.
No matter how impatient he may be to get on, he must be
drilled at this exercise till he becomes a thorough master of it.
The grand doctrine to be instilled into him at first is, to do his
work well and correctly; swiftness will follow as a natural
consequence. He sets a second line; and after it has been
made faultless he proceeds with the third, and so on till the
stick is full. The utmost care must be taken to keep every
letter and every line in an exact vertical position; and when
he essays to empty the stick he must be taught to lift the entire
mass in one square solid body, and to place it squarely and
vertically on the galley. If the lines are allowed to slant either
backward or sidewise, it is difficult afterward to make them
stand accurately.</p>

<p>After the apprentice has become thoroughly conversant
with the shape of every type, and can distinguish “u” from “n,”
“b” from “q,” and “d” from “p,” he is allowed to distribute
type for his own use. He is taught to take up at one time no
more matter than he can conveniently grasp in his left hand,
which he holds so that the light falls on the face of the type,
and his eye can readily read it. In distributing the various
letters, he takes a word or two between the thumb and forefinger
of his right hand, and the types are lightly dropped into
their respective boxes.</p>

<p>At the outset, and as he proceeds, the novitiate must be
cautioned against the acquisition of bad habits; such as swinging
the body as the types are picked up, nicking the type
against the stick several times before placing it in line, standing
on one leg, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>While avoiding these ridiculous practices, a learner must
acquire (if he does not possess them already) certain habitudes
or principles which lie at the foundation of successful effort.
The first is</p>

<p><i>Punctuality.</i> He must conscientiously observe the time-rules
of the office in coming and leaving. The early hours are
the best for work; and the mind being cheered by the consciousness
of doing right, the body feels the influence, and is
strengthened; and when the quitting hour arrives, the amount
of work accomplished will satisfy himself and his master too.
The most successful masters have been distinguished for
punctuality. The apprentice’s time is not his own, but his
master’s property; and wasting it by want of punctuality, or
idling during his master’s absence, is simply equivalent to
stealing. The second point is</p>

<p><i>Obedience.</i> The apprentice has no right to question orders
given by the master or his deputy. His duty is promptly to
do as he is told, without grumbling or dissatisfaction. Let
him remember that he is under orders, and that, if he ever
expects to learn how to command, he must learn in his youth
how to obey. He will promote his own interests by seeking
to anticipate his master’s wishes, and by endeavouring to make
himself so useful that his services cannot well be dispensed
with. Akin to this is</p>

<p><i>Courtesy.</i> Good manners in a youth are wonderfully pleasing,
and effectively aid in his advancement. Courtesy toward
his master is a matter of course, and deserving of little commendation;
but he must be courteous to customers when
sent out on an errand, and courteous to the workmen in the
office. By this means he will secure good-will, and many a
friendly hint will be given to him in acquiring a knowledge of
the art. The habit when fixed will bless him and others as
long as he lives.</p>

<h3>PLAN OF CASES.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">The</span> following schemes show the order in which the letters
are kept in cases in this country. In some offices,
however, slight deviations will be found,—such as the transposition
of the comma and w, y, p, &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<h3>POSITION.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">The</span> standing position of a compositor should be perfectly
upright, without stiffness or restraint; the shoulders
thrown back, the feet firm on the floor, heels nearly closed,
and toes turned out to form an angle of about forty-five degrees.
The head and body should be kept perfectly steady, except
when moving from the Roman to the Italic case, the operations
of distributing and composing being performed by the various
motions of the arm, from the shoulder-joint alone; and if, to
reach a box placed in the further part of the cases, to put in
or take out a letter, he should incline the body by a slight
motion, he should immediately resume his erect position.
The height of a compositor and his frame should be so adjusted
that his right elbow may just clear the front of the lower case
by the a and r boxes, without the smallest elevation of the
shoulder-joint; his breast will then be opposite the space, h,
and e boxes. Sitting at work should be rarely permitted, except
for lameness, weakness, old age, or other infirmity; and
then the stool should be a small piece of board fastened to a
single leg. Habit will render a standing position familiar and
easy; perseverance in conquering a little fatigue will be amply
repaid by the prevention of knock knees, round shoulders,
and obstructed circulation of the blood and respiration of the
lungs.</p>

<h3>LAYING TYPE.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Unwrap</span> carefully the page received from the type-founder,
and, laying it on a galley, soak it thoroughly
with thin soap-water, to prevent the types from adhering to
one another after they have been used a short time. Then, with
a stout rule or reglet, lift as many lines as will make about an
inch in thickness, and, placing the rule close up on one side
of the bottom of the proper box, slide off the lines gently,
taking care not to rub the face of the letter against the side of
the box. Proceed thus with successive lines till the box is
filled.</p>

<p>Careless compositors are prone to huddle new types together,
and, grasping them up by handfuls, plunge them pell-mell
into the box, rudely jostling them about to crowd more
in. This is an intolerable practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The type left over should be kept standing on galleys, in
regular order, till the cases need replenishment. A fount of
five hundred pounds of Pica may have, say, four cases allotted
to it; the same amount of Nonpareil, from eight to ten cases.</p>

<h3>DISTRIBUTING.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">When</span> a learner can infallibly distinguish from each other
the letters b and q, d and p, n and u, and l and I, he
may be allowed to distribute type for himself.</p>

<p>The head of the page being turned toward him, the learner
sets a composing-rule behind the portion to be lifted, and then,
placing his thumbs against the rule and his forefingers against
the top line, while his remaining fingers press together both
sides, he raises the matter quickly. Then, inclining sidewise
his right hand, he removes the left, and allows the matter to
balance momentarily in his right, while he doubles in the third
finger and stretches out the thumb of the left for the reception
of the matter, which he at once places in it, the rule lying as
a support on the third finger, while the thumb and other fingers
embrace the sides. He should take up but a few lines at
a time, until he acquires facility in lifting. Large handfuls
should always be avoided, as the weight is fatiguing and
weakening to the wrist.</p>

<p>Keeping the handful in an inclined position, so that he may
readily read the lines, he takes up as many letters as he can
conveniently hold between his fingers,—an entire word, if
practicable,—and drops the types slantingly, but with face
upward, into the several boxes.</p>

<p>The first aim of the learner must be accuracy, even though
his progress be slow. Correct distribution aids in clean composition.
In time he will be able to drop his types rapidly,
with hardly a glance at the boxes; and, while his fingers are
flying about correctly and expeditiously, his eyes will take in
the next word to be distributed; thus proceeding till the case
is filled.</p>

<p>In distributing, the utmost care should be taken in placing
the various spaces in their appropriate boxes. A mixing of
spaces characterizes the botch.</p>

<p>The letter-board should always be kept clean, and the bottom
as well as the face of the form well washed before it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
laid on the board and unlocked; for, if any dirt remain in the
type after the form is unlocked, it will sink into the matter.
This precaution taken, the pages should be well opened, and
the whole form washed till the water appears to run from it in
a clean state. If the form is very dirty, it is best to lock it up
again and rinse the bottom of it, and proceed as before.</p>

<p>It is sometimes necessary to dry the letter at the fire after
distributing. In this case, the type should not be used until it
is perfectly cold, as very pernicious effects arise from the antimony
in the composition of which the type is made. The
noxious vapour which arises is sufficient warning of the effects.
The compositor ought always to avoid it as a pestilence
which will affect his respiration and his sinews, inducing
lung-complaints, and causing paralysis of the hand or contraction
of the fingers. Where it can be conveniently managed,
it is better to distribute at night, or before meals, so that the
letter may dry without artificial heat.</p>

<h3>COMPOSING.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">When</span> copy is put into the hands of the compositor, he
should receive directions respecting the width and
length of the page; whether it is to be leaded, and with white
lines between the breaks; and whether any particular method
is to be followed in the punctuation and in the adoption of
capitals. These instructions being given, the compositor will
make his measure to the number of ems directed, which is
done by laying them flatwise in the composing-stick, and then
screwing it up sufficiently tight to prevent the slide from
moving. He then fits a composing-rule to the measure, and,
his case being supplied with letter, he commences his work.</p>

<p>The left hand, which contains the composing-stick, should
always follow the right, which takes up the letters. If the left
be kept stationary, considerable time is lost in bringing each
letter to the stick, because the right hand has, consequently,
to traverse a much greater space than is necessary. The eye
should always precede the hand, constantly seeking for the
next letter while the fingers are picking up one just selected.
Each letter should be taken up by the upper end. This
method will effectually prevent any false motion, and preclude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the necessity of turning the letter when in the hand. If possible,
a sentence of the copy should be taken at one time, and,
while putting in the point and quadrate at the end of the sentence,
the eye may revert to the copy for the next. It is to
dexterity in these particulars that compositors are indebted
for swiftness. The time thus gained is very considerable,
while all appearance of bustle or fatigue is avoided. By taking
a sentence into the memory at one time, the connection of the
subject is preserved, and the punctuation rendered less difficult.</p>

<p>Those who are careful in distribution find the advantage of
it in composition. Foul or slovenly workmanship is disgraceful.
To avoid this, a compositor should accustom himself to
glance over each line as he justifies it, and correct any error
as he proceeds, which he may do with little impediment to
his progress.</p>

<h4>SPACING.</h4>

<p>Uniformity in spacing is, unquestionably, a most important
part of a compositor’s occupation; this requires both care and
judgment, and, therefore, cannot be too strongly impressed
upon the mind of the beginner. Close spacing is as unworkmanlike
as wide spacing, and neither ought to be permitted
except in very narrow measures; and, frequently, even then
with care it might partly be prevented. What is commonly
called the thick space is the proper separator between words;
though this rule cannot always be adhered to in narrow
measures when large type is used. It is not sufficient merely
to have a line here and there uniformly spaced: a careful compositor
will give every page that uniformity of appearance
which is a chief excellency. The beginner should remember
that it is better to do little, and do that little <em>well</em>, than to put
together a great number of letters without any regard to
accuracy and uniformity.</p>

<p>Where a line is evenly spaced, and yet requires justification,
the additional space should be put between those words in the
line where it will be least observable: viz. a d and an h, being
tall, perpendicular letters, will admit an increase of space
between them, but not more than a middle and thin space to
a thick-spaced line; and an additional space may be placed
after a kerned letter, the beak of which may bear upon the top
of an ascending letter,—as the f followed by h, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>The same rule should be observed where it is necessary to
reduce the spacing of a line, less space being required after a
sloping letter than after a perpendicular one. The comma
requires only a thick space, but the other points should have
a hair space before and an en quadrate after them, except the
full-point, which should have an em quadrate, as terminating
a sentence. Should it be necessary to reduce the spacing
generally, the spaces after the points must be altered in the
same proportion. Spaces are cast to such regular gradations
that the compositor can urge no reasonable excuse either for
bad justification or improper spacing.</p>

<p>In matter to be stereotyped, a hair space should be placed
after the letter f and other kerned letters when they stand at
the end of the line.</p>

<h4>JUSTIFYING.</h4>

<p>Accurate justification is absolutely essential, as the letters
will be warped sidewise in a loose line, making it impossible
to get a fair impression from the type. Besides, the letters are
liable to be drawn out by the suction of the rollers, to the detriment
of the form and the press. The instructor of an
apprentice should occasionally pass his finger along the side
of matter set by him; and if the lines should not prove evenly
justified, they should be put into the composing-stick again
and properly corrected.</p>

<h4>HEAD-LINES.</h4>

<p>Head-lines are generally set in small capitals of the same
fount, or in Italic, and sometimes in capitals. Italic capitals
of letter somewhat smaller than the body of the work, with
folios of a proportionate size, have a neat appearance.</p>

<h4>NOTES.</h4>

<p>The usual rule for note-type is two sizes less than the text
of the work: thus, to Pica work, Long Primer; Small Pica,
Bourgeois; Long Primer, Brevier. Side-notes are usually
smaller in proportion. When side-notes or references drive
down below the lines of the text to which they refer, the expedient
of cut-in notes must be resorted to. This is a difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
part of a compositor’s business, and requires skill and patience
to adjust all parts, so that every line of note and text may have
proper and equal bearing. The reglet or lead between the
lines of matter and the side-note must be cut with as much
nicety as possible to the length of the text, as far as where the
note is to run under; and, having accurately adjusted, by
means of the quotations and justifiers, the situation of the first
line of the note, such lead or reglet is added to the text as will
make it precisely correspond in depth with the lines of note
that stand on the side before turning: the remainder of the
note is then set in a long measure, to correspond in width with
the text, reglet, and side-note; and the page is made up with
note, or the text begun again after the note is finished. In
Bibles with notes and annotations, in law-books, and other
works, it frequently happens that a page exhibits several of
these alternate frameworks of note and text, which, if done
well, display a workman’s skill to great advantage.</p>

<h4>BLANKING.</h4>

<p>If the work is very open, consisting of heads, whites, &amp;c.,
the compositor must be particularly attentive to their depth;
so that though the white may be composed of different-sized
quadrates, yet their ultimate depth must be equal to the regular
body of the type the work is done in; otherwise the register
of the work will be incomplete. The pressman cannot make
the lines back if the compositor is not careful in making up
his matter.</p>

<h4>PARAGRAPHS.</h4>

<p>The first line of a new paragraph is indented an em quadrate,
of whatever type the work may be; though, when the
measure is very wide, two or even three ems are preferable.
By this means the paragraph is more strongly marked, the
indention of an em only being scarcely perceptible in a long
line. Authors vary materially in the mode of making paragraphs.
Some carry the argument of a position to a great
length before they relieve the attention of the reader; while
others break off at almost every place that will admit only of
a full-point. But the author’s plan is to be followed, unless he
direct otherwise. Authors should always make the beginning
of a new paragraph conspicuous to the compositor, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
indenting the first line of it far enough to distinguish it from
the preceding line in case it should be quite full.</p>

<p>It is a practice too prevalent among compositors to drive
out a word at the close of a paragraph, or even to divide it, in
order to reap the advantage of a break-line. Part of a word,
or a complete word, in a break-line, if it contain no more than
three or four letters, is improper. It should be the business
of the proof-reader to notice and check this irregularity.</p>

<p>The last line of a paragraph should not on any account
begin a page, neither should the first line of a paragraph come
at the bottom of a page if the work has white lines between
the breaks: to prevent this, the compositor may make his page
either long or short, as most convenient, always taking care
that the odd and even pages back, so that the extra length or
shortness of the page may escape observation.</p>

<h4>INDEXES.</h4>

<p>The index is generally placed at the end of the volume, and
set in letter two sizes less than that of the work. It is always
begun upon an uneven page. In setting an index, the subject-line
should not be indented; but, if the article make more
than one line, all but the first should be indented an em.</p>

<p>In preparing the copy of an index, care should be taken
that the subject-words are arranged alphabetically, as the
compositor will not transpose his matter afterward without
remuneration.</p>

<p>Where several index-figures are used in succession, a comma
is put after each folio; but, to save figures and commas,
the succession of the former is noted by putting a dash between
the first and last figures: thus, 4-8. Again, if an article has
been collected from two pages, the folio of the second is supplied
by <i lang="la">sq.</i>, or <i lang="la">sequente</i>, and by <i lang="la">sqq.</i>, or <i lang="la">sequientibus</i>, when an
article is touched upon in succeeding pages. A full-point is
not put after the last figures, because it is thought that their
standing at the end of the line is a sufficient stop. Neither is
a comma or a full-point placed to the last word of an article
in a wide measure and open matter with leaders; but it is
proper to use a comma at the end of every article where the
figures are put close to the matter, instead of running them to
the end of the line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<h4>TITLES.</h4>

<p>Ornamental type may be used to good purpose in fancy
jobs, and without violating any of the canons of a correct taste.
The universal eye is pleased with ornament; and it is well to
foster this fancy, just as we cultivate a poetical feeling, or a
passion for music, or flowers, or any beautiful thing that God
has made. But, as life should not be all music, or flowers, or
poetry, so printing should not be all ornament. And as men
whom nature puts in the fore-front of all other men are noted
for a becoming simplicity of life and style, so the title-page
that heralds all the inner pages of a book should be printed in
a style of elegance severe and unadorned: no fancy type,
except a line of Scribe Text, or Old English,—no italics, unless
perchance a single-line motto in Pearl caps,—no bold-face
type, nor Antique, nor Gothic,—but plain, clear, light-faced
letters that seem the embodiment of the soul of thought. All
experienced printers incline to this simple style; but publishers
sometimes interfere with this province of art legitimate
only to a typographer, and insist on the indulgence of a taste
which certainly owes no allegiance to any of the laws of
beauty; and the printer or stereotyper who executes the book
receives credit for a title-page which he would fain utterly
repudiate.</p>

<p>We add a few hints which may assist the learner. 1st.
Having divided the title into lines, and decided upon the size
of type suitable for the principal one, begin by composing
those of the second and third class, both in ascending and descending
order. 2d. Avoid having two lines of equal length
to follow or come in contact with each other. 3d. Catch-words
should be set on quite a reduced scale, and proportioned according
to the strength of the preceding and succeeding lines;
for bold catch-words detract from the general effect of the title.
4th. Close attention should be given to those title-pages
which are acknowledged to be displayed with true taste and
judgment.</p>

<p>Authors should endeavour to make their title-pages as concise
as possible; for a crowded title can never be displayed
with elegance or taste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<h4>DEDICATIONS.</h4>

<p>The dedication generally follows the title, and seldom exceeds
one page. It should be set in capitals and small capitals,
neatly displayed. The name of the person to whom the work
is dedicated should always be in capitals, and the terms, Your
very humble and very obedient, &amp;c., should be in a smaller
type, and the signature or name of the author in capitals of a
smaller size than that in which the name of the personage is
printed to whom the book is dedicated.</p>

<h4>CONTENTS.</h4>

<p>The contents follow the preface or introduction, and may be
set either in Roman or Italic, generally two sizes smaller than
the body of the work; the first line of each summary full,
and the rest indented an em quadrate, with the referring figures
justified at the ends of the respective lines.</p>

<h4>PREFACES.</h4>

<p>Formerly, the preface was uniformly set in Italic; at present
Roman is used, one size larger or smaller than the body of the
work. The running title to the preface is commonly set in the
same manner as that of the body of the work. If the work
has been printed without a running title, and paged in the
centre of the line only, then the preface should be treated in
like manner.</p>

<h4>SIGNATURING.</h4>

<p>The title, preface, &amp;c. of a volume are commonly left till the
body of the work is finished, as circumstances may arise in
the course of its progress through the press which will induce
the author to alter his original preface, date, &amp;c., or the work
may conclude in such a manner as to admit of their being
brought in at the end, in order to fill out a sheet, and thus save
both paper and press-work. For this reason, it is well to begin
the first sheet of every work with signature B (or 2), leaving
A (or 1) for the title-sheet.</p>

<p>It was formerly the custom to omit the letters J, V, and W
in the list of signatures. But the greater convenience attending
the use of twenty-five letters has recently induced several
of our largest establishments to omit the letter J only.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<h4>ERRATA.</h4>

<p>The errata are put immediately before the body of the
work, or at the end of it. They should consist only of such corrections
as are <em>indispensably necessary</em>, without noticing any
defects in the punctuation, unless where the sense is perverted.
It is strongly to be wished that works could be produced perfectly
free from errors; but this is almost a vain hope while
imperfection clings to humanity, and while every form is exposed
to accident and every additional proof may be productive
of fresh error.</p>

<h3>HINTS HONOURED IN THE BREACH.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">When</span> you lay a fount of new type, don’t open the papers
carefully, and place the lines evenly with a brass rule
in the cases, nick up; but show your skill by tumbling over
each package rapidly, and bringing it down with a rush on the
imposing-stone; then, roughly throwing the a’s into a chaotic
pile, grab them up by handfuls and work them well down in
the appropriate box. The harder you jostle them down, the
more you will get in. Proceed thus with each letter; and, if
the operation has been vigorously performed, the value of the
fount will have been reduced, say ten per cent.</p>

<p>2. While you set out one case, let your galley lie on the
overheaped type of another case.</p>

<p>3. If a line is rather too tight to permit the last letter to get
in easily, push it down hard with your rule or a quadrate.
The type may be injured; but why didn’t it fit in just right at
first?</p>

<p>4. Empty your matter at a gentle inclination on the galley,
and make it up at the same angle. You can bring it right
afterward—perhaps—by the energetic application of mallet,
shooting-stick, and planer.</p>

<p>5. When the case is half set out, shake up the type energetically,
and do so very often. The exercise will strengthen
your muscles.</p>

<p>6. Don’t brush off the stone before you lay the matter down.
If any sand happens to get under, the type will show its impression
beautifully deep and clear on the face of the planer,—perhaps
a whole word or two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>7. Don’t plane till the form is locked up, as thus you save
the trouble of the first planing. But, now that you do plane,
hammer away, and show your musical ability in playing a
tattoo on the form. Don’t lay the planer tenderly and lovingly
on the types, as if you were afraid to hurt their feelings, and
gently tap it; but hold it off about a quarter or three-eighths
of an inch, and then bring down the mallet with a will. Phew!
how the planer will descend obedient to the stroke, and rebound
again, and perhaps again. If the form is not smooth
on the surface now, it is not your fault. Repeat this each time
when the form is locked up, till it goes to press; and you
may depend on it the impression will gain in boldness, if not
in looks.</p>

<p>8. When correcting your numerous errors, don’t trouble
yourself to lift the lines carefully at the ends, but dig right into
the head of the erring letter, and, resting your bodkin on the
type below it, pry up the sinner: it does not matter if you demolish
two or three types in the under line.</p>

<p>9. Wash your form energetically, and apply the ley bountifully
with a good stiff wiry brush. Never mind rinsing: clean
type is an old-fogy notion.</p>

<p>10. When the type is out of use, let it lie around promiscuously,—on
a table, or board, or any place where it will be
occasionally convenient to lay on it a mallet or tin basin. If
one strip of matter is placed on another, room will be economized.
Moreover, the under layers will be safe from dust.</p>

<p>11 (comprehensively). Do every thing in a loose way generally,
letting matters go as they list, throwing your pi into spare
boxes or secretly placing it on the letter-table or some out-of-the-way
place, stealing sorts from your neighbour, overcharging
time-work and extras, fishing for fat takes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>12. If you observe these things faithfully and constantly,
and your employer does not kick you out of his office, why—you
do not get your deserts.</p>

<h3>TO THE APPRENTICE.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Aspiring</span> apprentice, a word or two in your ear. If you
desire success in any matter pertaining to this life or the
coming, you must have a purpose,—a determination that, God
helping you, you <em>will</em> achieve success. You may be poor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
friendless, unknown,—your clothing scant, your stomach half
filled,—your place may be at the foot of the ladder: no matter.
Whatever your position may be, do your duty in it, stoutly
and perseveringly, with your eye fixed far ahead and upward.</p>

<p>Keeping the purpose before you that you <em>will</em> rise, be obedient
to your employer, attentive to your business, obliging
to your shopmates, and courteous to strangers; and seize every
opportunity to improve your heart, your mind, and your workmanship.
Do every thing well,—no slighting, no hiding defects,
aiming always at perfection. Watch those who are
skilful, and strive to equal and excel them. Secure the friendship
of all by deserving it. Allow no opportunity of rendering
a service to pass without improving it, even if it cost you some
labour and self-denial. Be of use to others, even if in a small
way; for a time may come when they may be of service to you.
A selfish man may get ahead faster than you; but selfishness
is contemptible,—and you need not envy his success: when
you achieve your object nobly, you will enjoy it, and be respected.</p>

<p>Always bear in mind that <em>character is capital</em>. To gain
this, you must be so scrupulously honest that you would be as
willing to put live coals in your pocket as a penny that is not
yours. Never run in debt: do without what you cannot at
once pay for, even though you should suffer somewhat. No
matter what the amount of your earnings may be, save a portion
every week, and invest it in a savings-bank of good standing:
it will grow, and will stand you in good stead some day. Better
temporary abstinence and constant plenty afterward, than
unearned present comfort and future perpetual want. Never
lie, openly or covertly, by word or action. A liar may deceive
his fellows,—God and himself never. Conscious of falsity, a
liar can have no self-respect; without self-respect, reputation
cannot be achieved.</p>

<p>With a noble purpose as the end of all your actions, and
with actions becoming your purpose, your success is merely a
question of time,—always provided you have some brain and
abundant common sense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<h3>TO BEGINNERS.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Sanguine</span> beginners sometimes fail in their attempts to
establish themselves in business; and in many cases are
disposed to lay the blame on every thing and on everybody
except themselves. So we here give some rules—(in an ironical
way, to make them stick in the memory)—</p>

<h4>HOW NOT TO SUCCEED.</h4>

<p><span class="word1-smcap">1. Get</span> from your father, uncle, aunt, grandmother, or somebody,
four or five thousand dollars. You need not give notes
or any written obligations, as they may prove troublesome
some day.</p>

<p>2. Rent a comfortable room somewhere, no matter whether
in a business centre or not, but let it be showy and pleasant.</p>

<p>3. Spend one-fourth of your capital in furnishing the room
with matters of personal comfort. Provide an elegant desk, a
luxurious lounge, and a pivot-chair: why shouldn’t the master
of a printing office “take it easy”? Have a closet in your
desk, it is so handy for your whisky-bottle and cigar-boxes.</p>

<p>4. Get all you can from the type-founder, press-maker, and
paper-manufacturers. If they will give you credit for one-half
of what you buy, well and good: if they trust you for the
whole amount, all the better for you, and the more money you
will have on hand for jollifications.</p>

<p>5. Put up your sign—a handsome one—</p>

<p class="center gothic x120">B. Sipwell Lovepunch,<br />
Printer.</p>

<p class="noindent">and signalize its erection by keeping “open house” for all
comers between 11 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> and midnight. The mothers and
wives of all who become tight and go home loose will long
remember your public spirit.</p>

<p>6. Be at your office by nine in summer and ten in winter;
and, following Charles Lamb’s witticism, <em>that he who goes to
work late should quit early</em>, you need not return after dinner.
Let your foreman attend to the business: isn’t he paid for it?</p>

<p>7. When you do go into your office, curse and grumble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
promiscuously, and be sure to swear at the apprentices, to
show your spirit, and to let them know that you are master.
Be careful never to praise them or any of the hands, or they
may think they are worth higher wages.</p>

<p>8. Take work at any price that will keep it from a competitor,
no matter whether it pays or not. Perhaps you can save
something by giving short numbers, counting in imperfect
copies, using very common ink, &amp;c. The style is of no consequence:
you want to make money if you can, let others
improve the typographical art if they choose.</p>

<p>9. Cultivate the acquaintance of fancy folk, politicians, and
wit-livers. A fast horse or two wouldn’t be a bad thing to
bind their friendship; and, besides, you will never be at a loss
for a companion in your rides.</p>

<p>10. If you want new type, and the founder who made your
outfit won’t sell to you unless you pay off the old score, transfer
your patronage to another foundry. How can you expect
to get along if you pay your debts? Such a course would
compel you to sell your horse and to taboo rum-shops and
gay saloons, and to live economically; and this, you know,
wouldn’t do at all.</p>

<p>11. Get out a newspaper, and advocate the principles of
the strongest party, swearing thick and thin through every
thing. You need not bother yourself about writing original
matter; crib wherever you can. There are plenty of fellows
who want office,—lawyers particularly,—and they will write
slang enough to fill your columns. You might quietly levy
a little black-mail or hush-money from neighbours guilty of
indiscretions: dirty money will buy as much as clean.</p>

<p>12. You needn’t marry, unless some fond rich girl should
happen to fancy a fool. You know, you need not trouble yourself
much about her after you have secured her money: let
her father look after her welfare. If she dies broken-hearted,
why—she ought not to have been so sensitive.</p>

<p>13. You may be troubled occasionally by a qualm of conscience;
but this can be settled by a dram or two. After a few
doses, conscience will go to sleep, and trouble you no more,
unless you should happen to see a Bible or hear a sermon,
which as a matter of course you will try to avoid. It is true,
wreck and ruin will be sure to overtake you, and the devil will
catch you at last; but why worry yourself before the time?</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Comprehends</span>
a knowledge of
placing the pages so
that they may regularly
follow each other when
printed and the sheet
is folded up; and also
the mode of dressing
chases and the manner
of making the proper
margin. As many pages
as are required for a
whole or half sheet
being made up, the
compositor lays them
upon the imposing-stone,
placing the first
page with the signature
to the left hand
facing him, and then proceeds according to one of the schemes
on <a href="#Page_150">pp. 150-199</a>. These will be found to contain every necessary
imposition,—viz. folios, quartos, octavos, twelves, sixteens,
eighteens, twenties, twenty-fours, thirty-twos, thirty-sixes, forties,
forty-eights, sixty-fours, seventy-twos, ninety-sixes, and
one hundred and twenty-eights. We also introduce schemes
for imposing from the centre, by which means the blank or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
open pages may be thrown in the centre of the form, leaving
the solid pages on the outside to act as bearers for the rollers,
as well as for the better regulation of the impression.</p>

<p>All odd matter, for any form, should be divided into fours,
eights, twelves, and sixteens, which is the groundwork of all
the impositions except the eighteens, which differ from all the
others; for instance, sixteens, twenty-fours, and thirty-twos
are only octavos and twelves doubled, or twice doubled, and
imposed in half sheets: for example, the sixteens are two
octavos imposed on one side of the short cross; the twenty-fours
are two twelves imposed on each side of the long cross;
and a thirty-two is four octavos imposed in each quarter of
the chase. Thus, a sheet may be repeatedly doubled. By this
division, any form or sheet may be imposed, always bearing
in mind that the first page of each class must stand to the left
hand, with the foot of the page toward you. Having set down
the first page, then trace the remainder according to the scheme
which applies to its number; in proof of which, the standard
rule for all other impositions may be adopted,—namely, <em>the
folios of two pages, if placed properly beside each other, will
when added together make one more than the number of pages
in the sheet</em>; that is, in a sheet of sixteens, pages 1 and 16
coming together will add up 17, and so 9 and 8 will make 17, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In half sheets, all the pages belonging to the white paper,
and reiteration, are imposed in one chase. So that when a
sheet of paper is printed on both sides with the same form,
that sheet is cut in two in the short cross if quarto or octavo,
and in the short and long cross of twelves, and folded as octavo
or twelves.</p>

<h3>TYING UP PAGES.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">In</span> tying up a page, use fine twine, winding it four or five
times round it, and fastening at the right-hand corner, by
thrusting a noose of it between the several turnings and the
matter with the rule, and drawing it perfectly tight, taking
care always to keep the end of the cord on the face of the page.
While tying it, keep the forefinger of the left hand tight on
the corner, to prevent the page from being drawn aside.</p>

<p>The twine being fastened, the compositor removes the page
from the ledges of the galley, to see if the turns of cord lie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
about the middle of the shank of the letter; if they lie too high,—as
most commonly they do,—he thrusts them lower; and
if the page be not too broad, he places the fore and middle
finger of his right hand on the off side of the head of the page,
and his thumb on the near; then, bending his other fingers
under, he presses them firmly against the head of the page; he
next places the fingers of his left hand in the same position at
the foot of the page, and, raising it upright, lays it on a page-paper;
then, with his right hand he grasps the sides of the
page and the paper, which turns up against the sides of the
page, and sets it in a convenient spot under his frame, placing
it on the left hand, with the foot toward him, that the other
pages that are in like manner set down afterward may stand
by it in an orderly succession until he comes to impose them.</p>

<p>If the page be a quarto, folio, or broadside, it is, of course,
too wide for his grasp; and he therefore carries the galley and
page to the imposing-stone, and turns the handle of the galley
toward him, and, taking hold of the handle with his right
hand, he places the ball of the thumb of his left hand against
the inside of the head ledge of the galley, to hold it and keep
it steady, and by the handle draws the slice with the page
upon it out of the galley, letting the slice rest upon the imposing-stone;
he then thrusts the head end of the slice so far
upon it, that the foot of the page may stand an inch or two
within the outer edge of the stone, and, placing his left hand
against the foot of the page, he quickly draws the slice from
under the bottom of the page.</p>

<h3>LAYING PAGES.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">In</span> taking up his pages for imposition, the compositor tightly
grasps the paper on both sides of the page, in order that
it may be kept firm to the bottom of the page; for if it be
left slack, the letters will be liable to slip out, unless it be particularly
well tied up. Having conveyed it to the stone, he
next places the last two fingers of his right hand under the
head of the page, but not under the page-paper at the head of
it, still grasping the sides with his forefingers and thumb; he
then slips his left hand so that the palm of it may turn toward
the bottom, and, lifting the page upright on his right hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
with the left he removes the paper; he next grasps again the
foot-end of the page with his left hand, in the same manner as
the right holds the head of it, and, turning the face of the type
toward him, lays it squarely and quickly down, so that the
whole page may come in contact with the face of the stone at
the same time.</p>

<p>As this method, in inexperienced or careless hands, would
frequently endanger a page containing intricate matter, it will
be safer to place the pages at first on good, strong, but not
coarse and rough papers, and, when they are brought to the
stone, instead of lifting them up as just noticed, slide them off
the papers in the same manner as before directed respecting a
folio page on the slice galley, being careful that no particles
of dirt remain under the page.</p>

<h3>MAKING UP FURNITURE.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Having</span> ascertained that his pages are laid down right, the
compositor proceeds to dress the chases, which we will
suppose to be for a sheet of octavo. Accordingly he selects a
good pair of chases that are fellows in all respects; and,
having laid them over the pages for the two different forms,
he puts such gutter-sticks between page and page, and such
reglets along the sides of the two crosses, as will give the book
proper margins after it is bound.</p>

<p>To ascertain the proper distance, and to prevent wastage
of furniture, he takes short pieces of furniture, or quotations,
and quadrates or reglets, to fit the space between two pages;
then, pushing the pages close to them, he finds the exact width
of the furniture necessary, by trying the ends of various pieces,
always measuring from the edge of the lines of type above the
page-cords.</p>

<p>By observing a proper method in cutting up new furniture,
the same will be serviceable for other works as well as the one
for which it is intended, even though the size of the page may
differ, provided it agrees with the margin of the paper. The
gutters should be cut two or three lines longer than the page;
the head-sticks wider; the back furniture may run nearly
down to the rim of the chase, but must be level with the top
of the page, which will admit of the inner head-stick running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
in; the difference of the outer head-stick may go over the
side-stick, and the gutter will then run up between them.
The side-stick only need to be cut exact, and the furniture will
completely justify.</p>

<p>Wood and metal furniture, cut or cast to specific lengths
and widths, may now be had from the type-founders, the use
of which will save time, waste, and labour.</p>

<h3>MAKING THE MARGIN.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">The</span> next business is to arrange the margin, so that each
page may occupy one side of a leaf, and have the proper
proportion of white paper left at the sides as well as at the
head and foot. The page when printed should be a little higher
than the middle of the leaf, and <em>have a little more margin on
the outside than in the back</em>. This rule is often neglected by
careless or ignorant printers, and the appearance of the book
when bound is repulsive to the eye of taste.</p>

<p>One mode of making margin is the following:—For octavos,
measure and mark the width of four pages by compasses, on
a sheet of paper designed for the work, beginning to measure
at one extremity of the breadth of the sheet. The rest of the
paper divide into four equal parts, allowing two-fourths for
the width of two separate gutter-sticks; the remaining two-fourths
divide again into four equal parts, and allow one-fourth
for the margin along each side of the short cross, and one-fourth
for the margin to each outside page. But as the thickness
of the short cross adds considerably to the margin, reduce
the furniture in the back accordingly, and thereby enlarge the
outside margin, which requires the greatest share to allow for
the unevenness of the paper itself, as well as for pressmen
laying sheets unevenly when the fault is not in the paper.
Having thus made the margin between the pages to the
breadth of the paper, in the same manner proportion the margin
at the head to the length, and accordingly measure and
mark the length of two pages, dividing the rest into four parts,
one-fourth of which is allowed for each side of the long cross,
and one-fourth for the margin that runs along the foot of the
two ranges of pages. The furniture on both sides of the long
one must be lessened to enlarge the bottom margin, for the
reason assigned for extending the side margin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Go the same way to work in twelves, where, for the outer
margin along the foot of the pages, allow the amount of two-thirds
of the breadth of the head-sticks, and the same for the
inner margin, that reaches from the foot of the fifth page to
the centre of the groove for the points; and from the centre of
that groove to the pages of the quire, or the cut off, allow
half of the breadth of the head-stick. The margin along the
long cross is governed by the gutter-sticks; and it is common
to put as much on each side of the long cross as amounts to
half the breadth of the gutter-stick, without deducting almost
any thing for the long cross, since that makes allowance for
the inequality of the outer margin.</p>

<p>Another plan, more simple, is the following:—Having laid
the pages as nearly as possible in their proper places on the
stone, with a suitable chase around them, fold a sheet of paper
which has been wetted for the work, or one of the same size,
into as many portions as there are pages in the form, and,
holding the sheet thus folded on the first or left-hand page of
the form, one edge even with the left-hand side of the type,
place the adjoining page so that its left side may be even with
the right-hand edge of the folded paper, which will leave a
sufficient space between the two pages to admit the gutter-stick,
which should then be selected of a proper width to suit
the form in hand, as follows:—In octavos, about a Great
Primer less in width than the space between the pages, as
determined by the above rule; in duodecimos, about a Pica
less; in sixteens, about a Long Primer; and proportionably
less as the number of pages are increased. Having thus
secured the proper width for the gutter-sticks, cut them
somewhat longer than the page, and holding one of them between
the two pages, above the page-cord, close the pages up
to it; then open the folded sheet so as to cover the two pages,
and, bringing the fold in the paper exactly in the middle of the
gutter-stick, secure it there with the point of a pen-knife or
bodkin; the right-hand edge of the paper thus opened must
be brought to the centre of the cross-bar, which determines
the furniture required between it and the pages. Having thus
arranged the margins for the back and fore edge of the book,
proceed in like manner to regulate the head and foot margins,
by bringing the near edge of the folded paper even with the
bottom of the first page, and so placing the adjoining off page<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
that its head may be barely covered by the off edge of the
folded paper, which will give the required head margin. All
other sections of the form must be regulated by the foregoing
measurements, when the margins for the whole sheet will be
found correct.</p>

<p>The greater the number of pages in a sheet, the smaller in
proportion should the margin be: the folded paper, therefore,
should lie proportionally less over the edge of the adjoining
page, both for gutter and back, in a form of small pages than
in one of larger dimensions. A folio may require the page to
be half an inch nearer the back than the fore-edge; while a
duodecimo may not require more than a Pica em.</p>

<p>In imposing jobs where two or more of the same size, requiring
equal margins, are to be worked together, fold the
paper to the size appropriate for each, and so arrange the
type that the distance from the left side of one page to the left
side of the adjoining one shall be exactly equal to the width
of the folded paper, as before described.</p>

<p>Having dressed the inside of the pages, next place side- and
foot-sticks to their outsides; being thus secured by the furniture,
untie the pages, quarter after quarter, the inner page
first, and then the outer, at the same time forcing the letter
toward the crosses, and using every precaution to prevent the
pages from hanging or leaning; and, in order to guard against
accidents, when the quarter is untied, secure it with a couple
of quoins.</p>

<h3>LOCKING UP FORMS.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">First</span>, carefully examine whether the pages of each quarter
are of the same length; for even the difference of a
lead will cause them to hang. Test their exactness: place the
ball of each thumb against the centre of the foot-stick, raising
it a little with the pressure, and, if the ends of both pages rise
equally with the stick, it is a proof they will not bind; then fit
quoins between the side and foot-stick of each quarter and the
chase. After pushing the quoins as far as possible with the
fingers, make use of the mallet and shooting-stick, and gently
drive the quoins along the foot-sticks first, and then those
along the side-sticks, taking care to use an equal force in the
strokes, and to drive the quoins far enough up the shoulders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
of the side- and foot-sticks, that the letter may neither belly
out nor hang, and the lines be kept straight and even. Quoins
should be slanted on one side only, but the edges should not
be bevelled. The several quarters of a form should be partially
tightened before either quarter is finally locked up;
otherwise the cross-bar may be sprung.</p>

<p>Before locking up the form, plane the pages gently over all
the face. If this be properly done, a second planing is hardly
necessary, provided the justification is perfect and the pages
are all of the same length. But, as this is seldom the case, the
second planing can hardly be dispensed with.</p>

<p>It often occurs that the quoins, when locked up wet, stick
so tight to the furniture as to render it troublesome to unlock
them: in such cases, drive the quoin up a little, and it afterward
unlocks with ease.</p>

<p>Before lifting a form after it is locked up, raise it gently a
short distance, and look under it, to ascertain whether any
types are disposed to drop out. If all is right, carry it to the
proof-press, and pull a good proof. Then rub it over gently
with a ley-brush, rinse it well, and place it in a rack, and
deliver the proof, with the copy, to the proof-reader.</p>

<h3>MEMORANDA.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Each</span> part of the furniture should be in one piece where
it is practicable,—as, for instance, the gutters, the backs,
and the heads; but sometimes pieces will be wanted of a
width that is not equal to any regular size, and then two must
be used.</p>

<p>All the gutters of one sheet should be cut of a precise
length; so also with the backs and the heads; but each sort
should be of a different length from that of the others: thus they
can be easily distinguished from each other, and mistakes be
prevented.</p>

<p>The sheet being imposed, the stone should be cleared; the
saw and saw-block put in their places, the shears, the mallet,
planer, and shooting-stick, the surplus furniture, the leads,
the quoins, and every other article. The compositor will tie

to them their proportion.</p>

<p>The chase and furniture of one form should always be used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
for a similar form; that is, the chase and furniture of the outer
form should be again used for an outer form, and the chase
and furniture of the inner form should be again used for an
inner form; they should also be put round the pages in the
same order in which they were put about those of the preceding
forms. For want of care or thought in these apparently
trifling circumstances, trouble, inconvenience, and loss of time
frequently occur; for the register will be almost sure to be
wrong when this is neglected, and then the forms must be
unlocked and the leads changed, to correct the fault.</p>

<p><em>Before the form is printed, a proof should be taken and the
sheet folded, to make sure of the correctness of the imposition.</em></p>

<p>The preceding rules and directions were intended for type-forms,
and were formerly of universal necessity. Now most
books are printed from stereotyped or electrotyped plates.
The same instructions, however, are generally as applicable to
plate as to type pages.</p>

<h3>NOMENCLATURE OF SHEETS.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">When</span> a sheet of paper of Medium or larger size is folded
in two leaves, like most newspapers, it is called a <i>folio</i>;
when folded in four leaves, it is named a <i>quarto</i> or <i>4to</i>; when
folded in eight leaves, an <i>octavo</i> or <i>8vo</i>; in twelve leaves, a
<i>duodecimo</i> or <i>12mo</i>; in sixteen leaves, <i>sextodecimo</i> or <i>16mo</i>;
in eighteen leaves, <i>octodecimo</i> or <i>18mo</i>; in twenty-four leaves,
<i>vigesimo-quarto</i>, or <i>24mo</i>, and so on. The Latin names
beyond <i>duodecimo</i> are seldom used.</p>

<p class="smaller">Imposing in quires may be carried to any extent, by observing the
following rule:—first ascertain the number of pages, then divide them
into so many sheets of folio, and commence laying down the first two
and last two, which form the first sheet, and so on to the centre one,
always remembering that the odd pages stand on the left and the even
on the right; the folios of each two forming one more than the number
of pages in the work: for example, let us suppose the work to
consist of thirty-six pages, which is nine sheets of folio, then they
should be laid down according to the scheme at the foot of the opposite
page.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Undeniable</span> as is the fact
that a book marred by typographical
errors and grammatical
blemishes is a scandal
to the profession, it must be
admitted that a careful, steady,
and competent reader is indispensable
in every printing-office.</p>

<p>It is eminently desirable
that a reader should have
been previously brought up
a compositor. By a practical
acquaintance with the mechanical
departments of the
business, he will be better able to detect those manifold errata
which, unperceived by the man of mere learning and science,
lie lurking, as it were, in a thousand different forms, in every
sheet; and which, if overlooked, justly offend the taste and
discernment of all appreciators of correct and beautiful typography.</p>

<p>Some of the principal imperfections which are more easily
observed by the man of practical knowledge in the art of
printing are the following: viz. imperfect, wrong-founted, and
inverted letters, particularly the lower-case n, o, s, and u, as
well as p, d, b, and q; awkward and irregular spacing; uneven
pages or columns; a false disposition of the reference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
marks; crookedness in words and lines; bad making-up of
matter; erroneous indention, &amp;c. These minutiæ, which are
rather imperfections of workmanship than literal errors, are
apt to be overlooked and neglected by mere literary readers.</p>

<p>A person of a thoroughly cultivated typographical taste, a
quick eye, and a ready mind, though not a compositor, may
doubtless be competent to detect those minor deviations from
exact workmanship in a proof which the inexperienced and
the careless are apt to overlook. But, without these qualifications,
no person can be safely intrusted to read a sheet for
press, and the labours of the printer are liable to go forth into
the world in a manner that will reflect discredit on the employed
and give offence to the employer. No form, therefore,
ought to be put to press until it has been read and revised by
an <em>experienced</em> reader.</p>

<p>A thorough proof-reader, in addition to a general and practical
acquaintance with typography, should understand clearly
the grammar and idiomatic structure of his mother-tongue,
and have, as it were, an encyclopedic knowledge of the names,
times, and productions of its writers, as well as an entire
familiarity with the Bible especially, and with Shakspeare.
He should be, in fact, a living orthographical, biographical,
bibliographical, geographical, historical, and scientific dictionary,
with some smattering of Hebrew, Greek, Latin,
French, Spanish, Italian, and German. Yet all these accomplishments
are valueless unless he also possess a keen and
quick eye, that, like a hound, can detect an error almost by
scent. There are eyes of this sort, that with a cursory glance
will catch a solitary error in a page. The world is little aware
how greatly many authors are indebted to a competent proof-reader
for not only reforming their spelling and punctuation,
but for valuable suggestions in regard to style, language, and
grammar,—thus rectifying faults which would have rendered
their works fair game for the critic.</p>

<p>Although no corrector of the press can strictly be required
to do otherwise than to <em>follow his copy</em>,—that is, faithfully to
adhere to the original, with all its defects,—yet every one must
perceive that he performs a friendly and perhaps a charitable
service, by pointing out, in proper time, imperfections and
mistakes which have escaped the observation of a quick or
voluminous writer. With the spirit, the opinions, the whims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
of an author, no corrector of the press has any business to
interfere. In reprints of old and standard works, no license of
alteration ought to be granted to either correctors or editors.</p>

<p>Strict uniformity should always be preserved in the use of
capitals, in orthography, and punctuation. Nothing can be
more vexatious to an author than to see the words <i>honour</i>,
<i>favour</i>, &amp;c. spelt with and without the <i>u</i>. This is a discrepancy
which correctors ought sedulously to prevent. The
above observations equally apply to the use of capitals to
noun-substantives, &amp;c. in one place, and the omission of them
in another. However the opinions of authors may differ in
these respects, still the system of spelling, &amp;c. must not be
varied in the same work.</p>

<p>When an author gives him the option, a proof-reader ought
to spell ambiguous words and arrange compounds in a methodical
and uniform way; and, to enable the compositors to
become acquainted with and to observe his method, he should
furnish for their guidance a list of such ambiguous words and
compounds.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Such being the qualifications of a reader, we exhibit the
process which proof-sheets ought to undergo before the pages
are put to press.</p>

<p>When a first proof is pulled, the compositor who imposed
the sheet ought to collect and arrange the copy, and deliver
both to the reader, who, after folding the sheet to prove the
accuracy of its imposition, carefully examines the signatures,
head-lines, and paging. He then calls his reading-boy, to
read the copy aloud to him. This boy should be able to read
with ease and distinctness any copy put into his hands. The
eye of the reader should not follow, but rather precede, the
voice of the boy: accustomed to this mode, he will be able to
anticipate every single word in the copy; and, should a word
or sentence happen to be missing in the proof, his attention
will the more sensibly be arrested by it when he hears it pronounced
by his reading-boy. He ought to be careful lest his
eyes advance too far before the words of the boy; because, in
his attention to the author’s meaning, he will be apt to read
words in the proof which do not actually appear there, and
the accuracy of the reading-boy will but tend to confirm him
in the mistake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>When the reading of the sheet is concluded, the number
(if more than one) of the volume, signature, and <i lang="la">prima</i>, or first
word of the ensuing sheet, should be accurately marked on
the margin of the copy, and a bracket made before the first
word of the next sheet, in order that the compositor, should
he not have composed beyond the sheet, may know where to
begin, without having the trouble of referring either to the
proof or the form, and the reader will be certain that the commencement
is right when he gets the succeeding sheet. This
prevents unnecessary trouble both to the reader and compositor.</p>

<p>Before the proof is sent to the compositor to be corrected in
the metal, an entry should be made in a book, according to
the following plan:—</p>

<p>This account being punctually kept, the reader can furnish
the employer or overseer with an exact account of the state of
each work without delay or inconvenience.</p>

<p>After the compositors have corrected the errors in the form,
a clean proof is pulled, which, with the first proof, is handed
to the reader, who then collates the corrected sheet with the
one before read, in order to ascertain whether the corrections
have been properly made, and whether new errors have not
been caused by negligence in the process; and, if the work be
a reprint, or if the author is not to examine the proof, he then
proceeds to read it very carefully for press.</p>

<p>Some proofs are so foul, that it is almost impossible for the
compositor to correct all the marks at one time, and it is
therefore necessary to have the neglected errors corrected and
another sheet pulled before the proof is read finally. It not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
unfrequently happens that compositors, in the course of correcting,
transpose a letter or word, or alter a letter in a word
that is not marked, thus not only leaving one error uncorrected,
but also making another; sometimes also, in respacing
a line, a space is transposed or a hyphen is left in. Consequently
it is absolutely necessary, in revising a proof, that the
reader should not only look at the word marked, but he ought
also to glance his eye over every line in which an alteration
has been made.</p>

<p>In offices where two readers are employed, it is advisable
that a proof-sheet should be read over by both; because the
eye, in traversing the same ground, is liable to be drawn into
mistake and oversight. The interest excited by the first reading
having abated, a degree of listlessness imperceptibly steals
upon the mind, which greatly endangers the correctness of a
proof. Should <em>outs</em> or <em>doubles</em> occur in a proof, it ought to be
again read by copy, to detect any improper correction in the
overrunning or transposition of lines. Figure work should
always be read twice by copy.</p>

<p>The duty of amending the punctuation should be generally
confined to one reader. Where a compositor is liable, in this
particular, to the whim or caprice of several readers, he certainly
suffers injustice, because his time is unnecessarily frittered
away; and not only is the work retarded, but the types
are needlessly exposed to injury, to say nothing of the liability
of creating fresh errors, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Before a manuscript is brought to the printer, it ought to be
as perfect as the author can make it. The compositor is bound
to “follow the copy,” in word and sentiment, unless, indeed,
he meets with instances of wrong punctuation or false grammar,
(and such instances are not rare,) which his intelligence
enables him to amend. After the matter has been read and
corrected in the office, a proof is sent to the author; and, if it
corresponds with the copy, the compositor’s responsibility is
at an end. He has done all he is paid for; and, should the
author desire any changes made in his matter, of course he
must pay for them.</p>

<p>Sentiments in print look marvellously different from the
same ideas in manuscript; and we are not surprised that
writers should wish to polish a little; nor do we object to
their natural desire of amending or beautifying their mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
products. But let them not forget that pay-time will come,—when
the item for alterations will loom out with a startling
distinctness in the bill. They found it easy in the proof to
erase a word or two here and insert a word or two there;
without dreaming, perhaps, that in consequence of these little
erasures and insertions the compositor would be compelled
to alter and reconstruct much of his work. We know of a
volume on which the alterations alone have consumed time
equal to one man’s work for nearly two and a half years.
How unreasonable—nay, how transparently unjust—the expectation
that the printer should give gratuitously the time
and trouble requisite for the radical changes in the type which
an author’s whim or taste may demand!</p>

<p>Stower says, “It may not be improper, in this place, just to
take notice of the great danger to the correctness of a work
which arises from the practice, too common with some authors,
of keeping their proof-sheets too long in their hands before
they are returned to the printer. As the pages in the metal
get dry, the adhesion of the types to each other is weakened,
and the swell or extension of the quoins and furniture, which
the moisture had occasioned, is removed; so that there is
great danger of letters falling out when a form is long kept
from the press. Nor is the danger which is hereby occasioned
to correctness the only inconvenience: the impatience of
authors to see their works in a fit state for publication is
almost proverbial. The pleasure arising from beholding, as
it were, the ‘form and texture’ of one’s thoughts, is a sensation
much easier felt than described. That authors, therefore,
may partake of this pleasure in a speedy and regular succession,
they should make a point of forwarding their proof-sheets
to the printer as quick as possible, not only that they
may the sooner be got ready for the press, but that the work
may proceed in a regular manner, without being interrupted
by the forwarding of other works in lieu of that the proof-sheets
of which are detained beyond the proper time in the
hands of the author.</p>

<p>“Authors are very apt to make alterations, and to correct
and amend the style or arguments of their works, when they
first see them in print. This is certainly the worst time for
this labour, as it is necessarily attended with an expense
which, in large works, will imperceptibly swell to a serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
sum; when, however, this method of alteration is adopted by
an author, the reader must always be careful to read the
whole sheet over once more with very great attention before it
is finally put to press.</p>

<p>“A proof-sheet, having duly undergone this routine of purgation,
may be supposed to be as free from errata as the
nature of the thing will admit, and the word ‘Press’ may be
written at the top of the first page of it. This is an important
word to every reader: if he have suffered his attention to be
drawn aside from the nature of his proper business, and errors
should be discovered when it is too late to have them corrected,
this word ‘Press’ is as the signature of the death-warrant
of his reputation. A reader, therefore, should be a
man of one business,—always upon the alert,—all eye,—all
attention. Possessing a becoming reliance on his own powers,
he should never be too confident of success. Imperfection
clings to him on every side. Errors and mistakes assail him
from every quarter. His business is of a nature that may
render him obnoxious to blame, but can hardly be said to bring
him in any very large stock of praise. If errors escape him,
he is justly to be censured; for perfection is his duty. If his
labours are wholly free from mistake,—which is, alas! a very
rare case,—he has done no more than he ought, and, consequently,
can merit only a comparative degree of commendation,
in that he had the good fortune to be more successful in
his labours after perfection than some of his brethren in the
same employment.”</p>

<p>The form being finally laid on the press, and a revise pulled
by the pressman, he sends it to the overseer, who carefully
examines whether all the marks have been attended to, and
looks along the sides and heads of the respective pages, to
observe whether any letter has fallen out, or there is any
crookedness in the locking up of the form, any battered letters,
or any <em>bite</em> from the frisket. Should the revise prove
faultless, he returns it to the pressman, with the word “Revise”
written on the margin; if otherwise, to the compositor to
whom the form belongs, for immediate correction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<h3>CORRECTING IN THE METAL.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Correcting</span> is the most disagreeable part of a compositor’s
business, diminishing as it does his earnings, and
causing great fatigue, and, by leaning over the stone, endangering
his health. A foul proof, however, is a fault without
extenuation, and seems to deserve some punishment. The
noise and confusion which prevail in badly governed printing-offices,
from light and frivolous conversation, not only retard
business, but distract the attention of the compositor from the
subject he has in hand, and cause him to make many mistakes.
Some men, no doubt, can support a conversation and at the
same time compose correctly; but their noise confuses those
who are unable to preserve accuracy except by close attention
to their copy in silence.</p>

<p>The first proof should contain merely the errors of the compositor;
but it frequently happens that the corrector heightens
them by his peculiarities. When this is unnecessarily done,
it is an act of injustice to the compositor: it is sufficient for
him to rectify such mistakes as arise either from inattention
to his copy or want of judgment. The compositor ought not
to suffer from the humour of a reader in capriciously altering
commas and semicolons in the first proof, which he not unfrequently
re-alters in the second, from a doubt as to the propriety
of the points to be adopted.</p>

<p>When a proof is handed to the compositor, he should immediately
correct it; and the reader, correlatively, should be
equally prompt in his department. Can it reasonably be
expected that the compositor will feel inclined to forward his
proof, when he knows that the reader will delay it for hours?</p>

<p>Should a compositor have transposed two or more pages,
either from an error in the folios or any other cause, he must
unlock the quarter containing them, and, loosening the cross
or crosses from the furniture, lift the chase and the remaining
quarters off the stone. Should he have furniture sufficient
round each page, he may move them into their proper stations
by pressing the balls of his thumbs and fingers against the
furniture at the head, foot, and sides of each page. If the
letter be small, it will be advisable to wet the pages, because
few imposing-stones are horizontal, or so steady that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
will not shake when touched, or by the motion of the floor
occasioned by persons walking or dragging forms along.</p>

<p>Should a compositor find that his pages <em>hang</em>, he must unlock
the quarter, and pat the face of the type with the balls of
his fingers until he gets it into a square position.</p>

<p>When a compositor unlocks a form, he should be careful
not to leave the unlocked quoins too slack, as the force necessary
to loosen the others may <em>squabble</em> the matter, or occasion
it to <em>hang</em>.</p>

<p>It has been aptly said, “What is required of a compositor
when he goes about correcting a foul proof, is a sharp bodkin
and patience; because, without them, the letter cannot escape
suffering by the steel, and hurrying will not permit him to
justify the lines true. No wonder, therefore, to see pigeon-holes
in one place, and pi in another.”<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>When the compositor has as many corrections between the
thumb and forefinger of his left hand as he can conveniently
hold, or, what is better, in his composing-stick, (beginning at
the bottom of the page, in order that they may follow regularly,)
and an assortment of spaces on a piece of paper, or,
what is more convenient, in a small square box with partitions
in it,—let him take the bodkin in his right hand, and,
instead of raising each letter he may have to alter, place the
point of the bodkin at one end of the line, and, with the forefinger
of his left hand against the other, raise the whole line
sufficiently high to afford him a clear view of the spacing; he
may then change the faulty letter and alter his spacing before
he drops the line. By this method he will not injure the
type, which he must do if he force the bodkin into their sides
or heads; a greater degree of regularity is insured where there
may be occasion to alter the spacing, and no more time is
taken up than by the other method.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>In tables, and other matter, where rules prevent the lines
from being raised, the letters must be drawn up by the bodkin.
This is done by the compositor holding the instrument fast in
his right hand, with the blade between his forefinger and
thumb, within about three-quarters of an inch from the point:
thus guiding it steadily to the faulty letter, he sticks the point
of the bodkin into the neck of the letter between the beard
and the face, and draws it up above the other types, so that he
can take it out with the forefinger and thumb of his left hand.
In performing this operation, the blade of the bodkin should
be kept as flat as possible on the face of the type, but it should
not touch any of the surrounding types, as the slightest graze
imaginable will injure their face, and they will consequently
appear imperfect in the next proof, when he will have the
trouble of altering them, his employer suffering the loss of
the type.</p>

<p>The bodkin blade being held almost flat to the form, a small
horizontal entrance of its point into the neck of the letter will
raise it above the face of the form; but, if the bodkin be held
nearly upright, it will not have sufficient purchase to draw the
letter up, because the weight of the letter and the pressure of
the surrounding types will have greater power than the sharp
point of the steel. By pressing sidewise, the bodkin blade
acts as a lever, even though it has no other purchase than the
slight motion of the hand.</p>

</div>

<p>In the olden times the printer made his own bodkin by
inserting the blunt end of a large steel needle in a piece of
wood or cork. At the present day, when every thing is prepared
to the workman’s hand, bodkins are manufactured by
printers’ furnishers, and he may take his choice of styles.
The above cut shows a common form; but in some cases (as
in table work) tweezers or a spring bodkin may be preferred.
Knives may also be had with bodkin attached, which serve
a double purpose. The objection to the knife-bodkin is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the handle is too heavy and cumbersome, and it is sure to
injure type should it happen to slip from the fingers and fall
on the page.</p>

<p class="caption">SPRING BODKIN.</p>
</div>

<p>The most careful compositor cannot at all times avoid
leaving a word out, or composing the same word twice. When
this happens, he should consider the best mode of rectifying the
accident, by driving out or getting in, either above the error
or below it. This ascertained, let the matter be taken upon
a galley, and overrun in the composing-stick. Overrunning
on the stone is an unsafe, unworkmanlike, and dilatory method,
destroying the justification and rendering the spacing uneven.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/tools-knifeandbodkin.jpg" width="250" height="150" alt="" />
<p class="caption">KNIFE AND BODKIN.</p>
</div>

<p>In correcting, care should be taken to avoid hair-spacing a
line, by overrunning either back or forward. In overrunning
the matter, the division should be used as little as possible;
for, though the compositor may carefully follow the instructions
laid down in this work on the subject of spacing and
dividing, yet the effect of his attention will be completely destroyed
if not followed up at the stone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>We here emphatically remark that, if authors were careful
to spell properly the names of persons and places, technical
and scientific terms, &amp;c., and to write legibly, marking the
end of sentences clearly, the work of the compositor would be
facilitated, many errors would be prevented, and time, temper,
and expense greatly economized.</p>

<p>Further. Let us remind authors that every correction made
on their proof that is a variation from the copy as furnished to
the printer is charged for according to the time required to
make it. The justice of the charge is obvious; yet, strange to
say, there is probably no item so frequently disputed by publishers.
A man employs a mechanic to build a house according
to fixed specifications; but, in the course of its erection, he
improves or changes the plan, and orders certain portions to
be torn down and rebuilt: is the mechanic to bear the loss?
Certainly not. So, when a compositor builds up his page of
type according to the copy furnished, he is right in requiring
compensation for alterations made in it. He is not to suffer
for the author’s desire to improve his intellectual edifice.</p>

a <i>matrix</i>, that the letters might easily be singly

matrices</i> for the whole alphabet: and when he
showed his master the letters cast from these
matrices, Faust was so pleased with the contrivance,

there were as many difficulties at first with

<h4>EXPLANATION OF THE CORRECTIONS.</h4>

<p>A wrong letter in a word is noted by drawing a short perpendicular
line through it, and making another short line in
the margin, behind which the right letter is placed. (See No. 1.)
So with whole words also, a line being drawn across the wrong
word and the right one written in the margin opposite.</p>

<p>A turned letter is noted by drawing a line through it, and
writing the mark No. 2 in the margin.</p>

<p>If letters or words require to be altered to make them more
conspicuous, a parallel line or lines must be made underneath
the word or letter,—viz. for capitals, three lines; small capitals,
two lines; and Italic, one line; and, in the margin opposite
the line where the alteration occurs, <i>Caps</i>, <i>Small Caps</i>, or
<i>Ital.</i> must be written. (See No. 3.)</p>

<p>When letters or words are set double, or are required to be
taken out, a line is drawn through the superfluous word or
letter, and the mark No. 4 placed opposite in the margin.</p>

<p>Where the punctuation requires alteration, the correct point
should be written in the margin. (See No. 5.)</p>

<p>When a space has been omitted between two words, a caret
must be made where the separation ought to be, and the sign
No. 6 placed opposite in the margin.</p>

<p>When a word should form a compound with another, it is
denoted as in No. 7.</p>

<p>When a letter has been omitted, a caret is put at the place
of omission, and the letter marked as No. 8.</p>

<p>Where a line is too widely spaced, the mark No. 9 must be
placed between the words and also in the margin.</p>

<p>Where a new paragraph is required, a quadrangle is drawn
in the margin, and a caret placed at the beginning of the sentence.
(See No. 10.)</p>

<p>No. 11 shows the way in which the apostrophe, inverted
commas, the star and other references, and superior letters
and figures, are marked.</p>

<p>Where two words are transposed, a line is drawn over one
word and below the other, and the mark No. 12 placed in the
margin; but where several words require to be transposed,
their right order is signified by a figure placed over each word,
and the mark No. 12 in the margin.</p>

<p>Where words have been struck out that have afterward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
been approved of, dots should be marked under them, and
<i>stet</i> written in the margin. (See No. 13.)</p>

<p>Where a space sticks up between two words, a horizontal
line is drawn under it, and the mark No. 14 placed opposite,
in the margin.</p>

<p>Where several words have been left out, they are transcribed
at the bottom of the page, and a line drawn from the
place of omission to the written words, (see No. 15;) but if the
omitted matter is too extensive to be copied at the foot of the
page, <i>Out, see copy</i>, is written in the margin, and the missing
lines are enclosed between brackets, and the word <i>Out</i> is
inserted in the margin of the copy.</p>

<p>Where letters stand crooked, they are noted by a line, (see
No. 16;) but, where a page hangs, lines are drawn across the
entire part affected.</p>

<p>When a smaller or larger letter, of a different fount, is improperly
introduced into the page, it is noted by the mark
No. 17, which signifies wrong fount.</p>

<p>If a paragraph is improperly made, a line is drawn from
the broken-off matter to the next paragraph, and <i>No ¶</i> written
in the margin. (See No. 18.)</p>

<p>Where a word has been left out or is to be added, a caret
must be made in the place where it should come in, and the
word written in the margin. (See No. 19.)</p>

<p>Where a faulty letter appears, it is denoted by making a
cross under it, and placing a similar mark in the margin, (see
No. 20;) though some prefer to draw a perpendicular line
through it, as in the case of a wrong letter.</p>

<p>Where a word has been accidentally separated by a space,
it is marked as in No. 21.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Vigilant</span> and conscientious oversight
is the price of profit and success.
An overseer or foreman of a printing-office
should be of more than ordinary capacity,
and able to keep his temper in firm control.
His conduct should be guided by justice
and equity in regard to the interests of
the employer and the employed. A strict
impartiality should be observed in his
treatment of the workmen, and no favouritism
should be displayed. He should
make himself acquainted with the capacity
of the men, and apportion work among
them accordingly. Some men are valueless
except for plain, straightforward composition;
others, distinguished for taste
and skill, delight in intricate work or matter
requiring ingenuity and delicacy, such
as tables, music, and algebra. Put one of the first kind on
this sort of composition, and he will botch it, and earn small
wages; while a workman of the latter class will become restive
and dissatisfied with plain, solid matter. While dealing justly
with the men under his charge, the foreman should see to it
that the employer suffers no detriment from negligent or dishonest
practices of unconscientious workmen, whether from
careless correcting, allowing dropped types to lie upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
floor, or overcharging, or other methods well known in a printing-office.
He should be the first and the last in attendance, in
order to satisfy himself that every person does his duty in
coming and leaving at the proper time.</p>

</div>

<p>The office having been thoroughly swept at an early hour,
and the type found in any alley having been placed in the
stick of the compositor occupying it, the foreman should pass
around the room and see that it is immediately distributed,
instead of being thrown on the window-frame or table. The
type found in the body of the rooms should be sorted out and
distributed at once, and not be allowed to accumulate. No pi
should be permitted to remain over till the next day. This is
an essential point to secure a tidy and well-regulated office.</p>

<p>He should see to it that the proof-roller and press are in
good condition, and that a sufficient supply of wetted proof-paper
is on hand. A badly-printed proof should never be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
allowed to go to
the proof-reader
or to the author,
as neither can
properly read a
blurred or imperfect
proof.
An author will
feel kindly toward
an office
that furnishes
him with handsome
impressions
of his matter.</p>

<img src="images/cabinet-sortcase.jpg" width="310" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SORT-CASE CABINET.</p>
</div>

<p>The foreman
should keep
himself fully informed
as to the amount and the condition of the materials in
the office, not only in gross, but in detail, including every
style of type,
every variety of
accents and peculiar
sorts,
leads, chases,
furniture, rules,
borders, corner-pieces,
&amp;c. In
this he will be
greatly aided by
insisting on the
observance of
the good old
rule, <em>A place for
every thing, and
every thing in
its place when
not in use</em>, as
well as by keeping
a memorandum-book in which every thing should be
entered under its proper head for facility of reference.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>If the office be
well provided, it
will contain one or
more of the cabinets
for sorts, such as
are shown in these
pages. Strict attention
should be given
to keeping them in
perfect order, and
in preventing them
from becoming receptacles
for pi.</p>

</div>

<p>As a matter of
course, he should
watch the progress
of every job and
book, and make
sure that they shall be completed within the time contracted
for. He should never allow a compositor to have a large take
of copy: small takes
facilitate expedition,
and really tend
to the profit of the
workmen by bringing
an earlier return
of letter. He should
see to it that every
man has his copy
closed in proper
time, so as not to
detain the make-up,
and that he passes
the make-up without
unnecessary delay.
As soon as a
form or sheet is
made up, he should
order it to be imposed
and a proof pulled, which, with the copy properly
arranged, is to be at once handed to the proof-reader. Nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
should he allow of any unnecessary delay on the part of the
reader, nor on the part of the compositors in correcting the
proof when read. When proofs are required by an author, the
foreman must forward them promptly to him, and request
him to return them at the earliest possible moment. If the
proof is not to be sent out, he should have the second reading
quickly performed, and the forms prepared for the foundry or
the press.</p>

<p>Systematic attention to the above points will tend to the
comfort of the overseer, to the advantage of the workmen, and
to the profit and satisfaction of the proprietor of the establishment.</p>

<p>The foreman will find a memorandum Press-Book very
useful, in which to make entries of the amount of the paper
given out by the warehouseman for the various works, the
number printed, &amp;c., as well as the names of the pressmen
when the work is done on hand-presses.</p>

<p>If not done by the proof-reader, the foreman should examine
the press revise; in doing which, he will be careful not
only to ascertain whether all the corrections marked in the
proof are made, but also to look carefully over the sides, head,
and bottom of each page. It frequently happens that the
folios drop out of the form in lifting it off the imposing-stone;
and in leaded matter, letters at the beginning and ends of lines
sometimes fall out of place. Before the revise is given to the
compositor, the name of the pressman who is to work off the
form should be entered in the Press-Book. With foul compositors,
he should require a second revise, in order to ascertain
if all the corrections have been made which were marked
in the first. He should (where there is not a pressman engaged
expressly for the purpose, as is the case in houses employing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
numerous machine-presses) go frequently to the different
presses, and examine the work, point out defects, if any, and
glance again over the heads, sides, and bottoms of the pages,
to see if any thing has been drawn out by the rollers, which
may occur from bad justification of the lines, and careless and
improper locking up of the form.</p>

<p>An active and conscientious foreman will not be content
with merely managing the concerns of the composing room:
he will also see that the business of the warehouse is attended
to with regularity and accuracy, and that the warehouseman,
errand-boys, and apprentices do their duty.</p>

<h3>CASTING OFF COPY.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">To</span> cast off manuscript with accuracy and precision is a
task which requires great attention and mature deliberation.
The trouble and difficulty are much increased when the
copy is not only irregularly written, (which is generally the
case,) but also abounds with interlineations, erasures, and
variations in the size of paper. At times, so numerous are the
alterations and additions as to baffle the skill and judgment
of the most experienced calculators of copy. Such an imperfect
and slovenly mode of sending works to the press cannot
be too strongly censured.</p>

<p>The first step necessary is to take a comprehensive view of
the copy, noticing whether it has been written even or has
many interlineations, &amp;c., and observing also the number of
break-lines, and whether the work be divided into chapters
and sub-heads, in order that allowance may be made for them
in the calculation. These observations may be noted on a
separate piece of paper, to assist the memory and save the
trouble of re-examining the manuscript.</p>

<p>This preparation being made, we ascertain the number of
words contained in the line by counting several separate lines
in various parts of the copy, so that the one we adopt may be
a fair average. We then take the number of lines in a page,
and multiply by the number of words found in the average
line: the result we then multiply by the quantity of folios the
manuscript copy may contain, and thus we get the amount
of words contained in the work with a tolerable degree of
accuracy. The necessary allowances should be made for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
break-lines, chapters, insertions, &amp;c., according to the observations
previously made on the memorandum.</p>

<p>If information has been furnished as to the size of letter the
work is to be done in and the width of the page, we make our
measure accordingly, and, by composing a few lines of the
manuscript copy, we ascertain what number of words will
come into each printed line: we then take the length of our
page in lines, and multiply the one by the other, thus getting
the number of words in the printed page. We divide the whole
number of words in the manuscript by the number contained
in the printed page: the quotient gives the number of pages
the manuscript will make. If too many, the page must be
enlarged; if too few, the page must be diminished in width
and length. For example:—We take the number of words in a
line of manuscript at 20, the lines in a page at 50; we multiply
50 by 20, which will produce 1000 words in a page; we then
multiply 1000 by 422, the number of folios in the manuscript,
and we find that it contains 422,000 words. The work being
printed in Pica octavo, 20 ems measure, and each line containing
10 words, each page 40 lines, the case will stand thus:—</p>

down by a predecessor:—</p>

<p>“After having made the measure for the work, we set a
line of the letter that is designed for it, and take notice how
much copy will come into the line in the stick,—whether less
or more than a line of manuscript; and, as it is seldom that
neither one nor the other happens, we make a mark in the
copy where the line in the stick ends, and number the words
that it contains. But, as this is not the safest way for casting
off close, we count not only the syllables, but even the letters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
that are in a line in the stick, of which we make a memorandum,
and proceed to set off a second, third, or fourth line,
till a line of copy falls even with a line in the stick; and, as
we did to the first line in the stick, so we do to the other,
marking on the manuscript the end of each line in the stick,
and telling the letters in each, to see how they balance against
each other. This being carefully done, we begin counting off,
each time, as many lines of copy as we know will make even
lines in the stick. For example, if 2 lines of copy make 3 lines
in print, then 4 make 6, 6 make 9, 8 make 12, and so on, calling
every two lines of copy three in print. In like manner we
say, if 4 lines make 5, then 8 make 10, and so on, comparing
every four lines of copy to five lines in print. And in this
manner we carry our calculation on as far as we have occasion,
either for pages, forms, or sheets.</p>

<p>The foregoing calculations are intended to serve where a
line of print takes in less than a line of copy; and, therefore,
where a line of print takes in more than a line of copy, the
problem is reversed, and, instead of saying, if 2 lines make 3,
we say, in this case, if 3 lines of copy make 2 lines in print,
then 6 lines make 4, 9 make 6, 12 make 8, and so on, counting
three lines of copy to make two lines in print. In this manner
we may carry our calculation to what number of pages, forms,
or sheets we will, remembering always to count off as many
lines of copy at once as we have found they will make even
lines in the stick. Thus, for example, if 5 lines make 7, the
progression of 5 is 10, 15, 20, &amp;c., and the progression of 7 will
be 14, 21, 28, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In counting off copy, we take notice of the breaks; and
where we judge that one will drive out, we intimate it by a
mark of this shape [; and again, where we find that a break
will get in, we invert it, thus, ]. And to render these marks
conspicuous to the compositor, we write them in the margin,
that he may take timely notice, and keep his matter accordingly.
We also take care to make proper allowance for heads
to chapters, sections, paragraphs, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In examining the state of the copy, we must observe
whether it has abbreviations, that we may guard against them
in casting off, and allow for them according to the extent of
the respective words when written out at length.”</p>

<p>The foregoing will convey a sufficient idea as to the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
mode of casting off copy; still, these remarks more properly
apply to regularly written and thoroughly revised copy. Upon
this subject, Smith justly observes,—</p>

<p>“But how often one or more of these requisites are wanting,
compositors can best tell; though very few will imagine that
among men of learning there should be some who write after
such a manner that even those who live by transcribing rather
shun than crave to be employed by them: no wonder, therefore,
if compositors express not the best wishes to such promoters
of printing. But it is not always the capacious genius
that ought to be excused for writing in too great a hurry; for
sometimes those of no exuberant brains affect uncouth writing,
on purpose to strengthen the common notion that <em>the more
learned the man, the worse is his <span class="upright">(hand)</span> writing</em>; which shows
that writing <em>well</em> or <em>bad</em> is but a habit with those that <em>can</em>
write.”</p>

<h3>HURRIED WORK.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">It</span> is sometimes necessary to print pamphlets and other
works of a temporary nature in the course of a few hours.
When a work of this kind is put in hand, the foreman selects
the requisite number of swift and skilful compositors, whose
first concern must be to appoint one from among them to
make up the matter, and to do every thing which would interfere
with the regular business of distributing, composing, and
correcting. While they are distributing letter, the <em>clicker</em>, or
person appointed to manage the work, procures the copy, with
all necessary information respecting it, and provides leads,
rules, and every other necessary sort. He then draws out the
following table:—</p>

<table summary="The clicker’s table" class="borders">
  <tr>
    <th>COMPOSITORS’ NAMES.</th>
    <th>FOLIOS OF COPY.</th>
    <th>LINES COMPOSED.</th>
    <th>MEMORANDUMS.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Farroe</td>
    <td class="tdr">1-&nbsp;&nbsp;5</td>
    <td class="center">184</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Wilson</td>
    <td class="tdr">6-10</td>

    <td class="tdr bb">11-16</td>
    <td class="center bb">121</td>
    <td class="bb"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>In the first column he writes the name of each compositor
when he takes copy; and, in the second, the folio of the copy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
that he may be able to ascertain instantly in whose hands it
lies. In the third column he sets down, opposite to the workman’s
name, the number of lines composed, as fast
as the galleys are brought to him. In the fourth,
he inserts such remarks respecting the copy, &amp;c. as
may be necessary, and also any circumstances that
may occur in the companionship.</p>

<p>When the work is finished, each man’s share of
lines is readily ascertained, and all disputes are
avoided. The publisher may expedite the progress
of the work by offering a copy of the book, or some
other token, as a premium to the compositor who
sets the largest number of ems. The maker-up or
clicker usually receives for his compensation the
head and foot lines, and two or three cents per
thousand, which is deducted from the wages paid to
the compositor. Sometimes the compositors work
“in pocket,” as it is called, or share evenly in the
proceeds. This, however, is not a satisfactory
mode, and its tendency is to retard the work, as
no man will be anxious to do more than his share.</p>

<p>When the compositors are ready for their first
taking of copy, it should be given to them in pieces
as short as possible, the first two beginning with
shorter takes than the others, to prevent delay in
the making up. During the time the first take is
in hand, the clicker sets the half-head, head-lines,
white-lines, and signature-lines, together with notes
and other extraneous matter.</p>

<p>When the first person brings his matter, the
clicker counts or measures off with a type-measure
the number of lines, and inserts them in the table;
he then gives him another take of copy, and proceeds
with the making up. The same plan is
observed with the rest of the compositors. When
the first sheet is made up, the clicker lays the pages
on the stone, and informs the foreman of it, who
has previously had chases and furniture prepared and the
clicker immediately imposes the form.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/tools-measure.jpg" width="500" height="50" alt="" />
<p class="caption">TYPE MEASURE.</p>
</div>

<p>The proofs should be read at once and given to the clicker
to have them corrected. As soon as this is done, he lays up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
the forms, and gives the proof to the compositor whose
matter stands first, who should immediately correct it, then
forward it to the next, and so on, till the sheet be corrected;
the clicker then locks it up and pulls the second proof, which
must be duly forwarded, and the type be locked up finally for
press.</p>

<p>The work will now proceed rapidly, provided the compositors
stick close to their work and there be no hinderance with
respect to letter, &amp;c.: this depends on the good management
of the foreman.</p>

<p>If the clicker find that he cannot make up the matter as fast
as it is composed, he should call one of the compositors to his
assistance, who must be the person last in copy.</p>

<h3>COMPANIONSHIPS.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Disputes</span> sometimes arise in a printing-office upon trifling
as well as important points, which should be settled by
a reference to the general custom and usage of the trade.
These annoying misunderstandings take place in companionships
consisting of several compositors; it is therefore highly
desirable that the generally received rules and regulations in
this regard should be explicitly laid down for the comfort and
government of the compositor.</p>

<h4>TAKING COPY.</h4>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/tools-composingrule.jpg" width="200" height="100" alt="" />
<p class="caption">STEEL COMPOSING RULE.</p>
</div>

<p>When the work to be taken in hand is a reprint which is to
be followed page for page, a fixed number of pages should be
given to each compositor as he comes in turn for copy; or, if
the work be in manuscript,
an equal average
amount should be
allowed as a take for
each compositor. None
of the hands should
have access to the copy,
but the foreman should
deal it out as wanted
with perfect impartiality, fat or lean as it may happen to run.
Otherwise, a compositor who has an acquaintance with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
copy may be tempted to loiter if the next take to be given
out be lean, or, if it be fat, to apply for copy before his work
in hand is finished. By this course, the foreman will prevent
all such sorts of sharp practice, and secure harmony in the
companionship. When the foreman gives out copy, he should
plainly mark the name of the compositor at the head of the
first page of the take if the work be a page-for-page reprint;
if it be manuscript, or a reprint in a different measure from
that of the copy, he should write the name at the beginning
of the first paragraph of the take. Most compositors desire
to have a large portion of copy, under the erroneous idea that
it will be to their advantage to make up many pages at once.
Small takes insure a more rapid execution of the work and
bring a quicker return of letter, and so tend to the profit of
the hands.</p>

<p>If one of the companionship absent himself, the man next
in order should close his copy, whether it be good or bad,
unless the larger portion of it be not set, in which case the
person who has the last take must go on with it.</p>

<h4>MAKING UP.</h4>

<p>The compositor who has the first take on the work proceeds
without delay to make it up as soon as he has completed it.
Having completed as many pages as his matter will make, he
passes the overplus, if
less than half a page,
with the correct head
and folio, to the compositor
whose matter follows
his, at the same
time taking an account
of the number of lines
loaned; if, on the contrary,
the overplus makes more than half a page, he borrows a
sufficient number of lines to complete his page; each compositor
keeping an account of the number of lines borrowed
and loaned. The second compositor, following the same
course, passes the make-up to the next in succession; each
man passing the make-up in like manner without unnecessary
delay.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/tools-steelmakeuprule.jpg" width="200" height="100" alt="" />
<p class="caption">STEEL MAKE-UP RULE.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<h4 class="clearnone">MAKING UP OF LETTER.</h4>

<p>The number of the companionship, if possible, should be
determined on at the commencement of the work, to enable
all to proceed upon an equal footing. The letter appropriated
for the work should be adequate to keep the persons on it
fully employed.</p>

<p>If any part of the matter for distribution, whether in chase
or in paper, be desirable on account of the sorts it may contain,
it should be divided equally, or the choice of it thrown for.</p>

<p>When a new companion is put on the work after the respective
shares of letter are made up, and if there be not a
sufficiency to carry on all the companionship without making
up more, he must bring on an additional quantity before he
can be allowed to partake of any part of that which comes
from the press.</p>

<h4>MAKING UP FURNITURE.</h4>

<p>The companions in rotation should make up the furniture
in turn, the one who has the last matter in the first sheet leading
off. Should an odd sheet be wanted, it will be better to
throw for the chance of making it up.</p>

<h4>IMPOSING AND DISTRIBUTING LETTER.</h4>

<p>The person to whose turn it falls to impose must lay up the
form for distribution. To prevent disputes, it will be well to
prepare a blank form, as follows, which may be filled up as
the work proceeds:—</p>

<table summary="The form" class="borders-all">
  <tr class="smaller">

    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>When the form is laid up, the letter should be divided
equally, and, if possible, each person should distribute the
matter originally composed by him; by this means, the sorts
which may have made his case uneven will return to him.
If any man absent himself beyond a reasonable time, his
undistributed matter should be divided equally among his
companions, and when he returns he may have his share
of the next division.</p>

<h4>CORRECTING, ETC.</h4>

<p>The compositor whose matter is first in the proof should lay
up the forms on the imposing-stone and correct it; he then
hands the proof to the
person who follows next.
The compositor who corrects
the last part of the
sheet locks up the forms.</p>

<p>The compositor who
has matter in the first
and last part, but not
the middle of the sheet,
only lays up the forms
and corrects his matter;
the locking up is left to
the person who corrects
last in the sheet.</p>

<p>A compositor having
the first page only of
the sheet is required to
lay up one form; also to
lock up one form if he
has but the last page.</p>

<p>If, from carelessness in locking up the form,—viz. the furniture
binding, the quoins badly fitted, &amp;c.—any letters, or even
a page, should fall out, the person who locked up the form
should repair the damage. But, if the accident occur from
bad justification, or from letters <em>riding</em> upon the ends of the
leads, the loss should fall upon the person to whom the matter
belongs.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/cabinet-chase.jpg" width="250" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption">CHASE CABINET.</p>
</div>

<p>It is the business of the locker-up to ascertain whether all
the pages are of equal length; and, though a defect in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
respect is highly reprehensible in the maker-up, (whose duty it
is to rectify it,) yet, if not previously discovered by the locker-up,
and an accident happen, he must make good the defect.</p>

<p>The compositor who imposes a sheet must correct the
alterations in that sheet. He must also rectify any defect in
the register arising from want of accuracy in the furniture.</p>

<p>Forms sometimes remain a considerable length of time
before they are put to press. In this case, particularly in summer,
the furniture is likely to shrink, and the pages may fall
out. It is therefore the business of the locker-up to attend
to it in this respect, or he will be subject to make good any
accident which his neglect may occasion.</p>

<p>When forms which have been worked off are ordered to be
kept standing, they are considered under the care of the foreman.
When they are cleared away, it is to be done in equal
proportions by the companionship. During the time any
forms may have remained under the care of the foreman,
should there have been any alteration as to form or substance
which were not made by the original compositors, they are
not subject to clear away those parts of the form thus altered.
To prevent dust from settling in the face of the type, it is well
to keep the forms in a chase cabinet.</p>

<p>If the pressman unlock a form on the press, and any part
of it fall out from carelessness in the locking up, he is subject
to the loss that may happen in consequence.</p>

<p>The compositor who locks up a sheet takes it to the proof-press,
and, after he has pulled a proof, hands it, together with
the foul proof, to the reader, and deposits the form in a place
appointed for that purpose.</p>

<h4>TRANSPOSITION OF PAGES.</h4>

<p>Each person in the companionship must lay down his pages
properly on the stone for imposition. The compositor whose
turn it is to impose looks them over to see if they are rightly
placed. Should they, after this examination, lie improperly,
and be thus imposed, it will be his business to transpose them;
but, should the folios be wrong, and the mistake arise from
this cause, it must be rectified by the person to whom the
matter belongs. Pages without folios or head-lines, laid down
wrongly for imposition, must be rectified by the person who
has been slovenly enough to adopt this plan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<h3>RULES AND REGULATIONS TO BE OBSERVED IN A PRINTING-OFFICE.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Compositors</span> are to receive their cases from the foreman
or his assistant, free from all pi or improper sorts,
with clean quadrate and space boxes, both Roman and Italic,
which they are to return to him in equally good condition.</p>

<p>2. When a compositor receives letter, furniture, &amp;c. from
the foreman, he is to return any portion not used, in as good
state as he received it, the same day.</p>

<p>3. When a case is taken out of the rack, the compositor is to
return it into the proper place immediately after he has done
with it.</p>

<p>4. No cases to be placed over others, or under the frames,
or on the floor.</p>

<p>5. Compositors are to impose their matter and pull a proof
as soon as made up, unless directed otherwise, and to correct
the proof without unnecessary delay.</p>

<p>6. The proof, when pulled, to be given to the reader, the
copy in regular order to accompany the first proof, and the
foul proof the second.</p>

<p>7. Compositors are not to leave either type or furniture on
the stone.</p>

<p>8. A compositor is not to detain an imposing-stone longer
than the nature of the business may require.</p>

<p>9. Head-lines, or other useful materials, on galleys, used
during the course of a work, to be cleared away as soon as the
work is finished.</p>

<p>10. When a work is done, the compositor, before beginning
another work, unless otherwise directed, is to clear away the
forms, taking from them the head-lines, white-lines, and odd
sorts, as well as the leads and reglets; which, with the furniture
of each sheet, and the matter properly tied up for papering,
are to be given to the foreman.</p>

<p>11. Types dropped on the floor to be picked up at once.
Matter broken by accident to be cleared away on the same day.</p>

<p>12. The saw, saw-block, bowl, sponge, letter-brush, shears,
bellows, &amp;c., to be returned to their respective places as soon
as done with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>13. Letter-boards, windows, frames, &amp;c., to be kept free
from pi.</p>

<p>14. No person to take sorts from the cases of another without
leave, nor hoard useful sorts, not wanting or likely to want
them.</p>

<p>15. Compositors employed by the week to work not less
than ten hours per day.</p>

<p>16. Unnecessary conversation to be avoided.</p>

<h3>HISTORY OF THE PRESS.</h3>

<img src="images/press-oldcommon.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="" />
<p class="caption">OLD COMMON PRESS.</p>
</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">While</span> poets and orators have
expatiated on the glory and
power of the press, rulers have exhausted
their cunning in attempts
to curb and regulate the art of
which it is the symbol. Hedged in
by arbitrary restrictions, it is not
wonderful that printing was long
carried on with clumsy implements.
The earliest press resembled a
screw-press, with a contrivance for
running the form of types under the point of pressure. After
the impression was taken, the screw was relaxed, and the form
withdrawn and the sheet removed.</p>

<p>This rude press continued in general use till 1620, when
<span class="smcap">Willem Jansen Blaeu</span>, at first a joiner and afterward a
mathematical instrument maker of Amsterdam, contrived a
press in which the bed or carriage was brought under the
point of pressure by moving a handle attached to a screw
hanging in a beam with a spring, the spring causing the screw
to fly back as soon as the impression was given. This movement
was afterward effected by means of a double strap or
belt, two ends of which were attached to an axle, and the
others to opposite ends of the bed. The platen was so small
that two pulls were necessary to print one side of a sheet, and
each sheet, therefore, required four pulls to produce a complete
impression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adam Ramage</span>, who came from Scotland to Philadelphia
about 1790, and who for a long time was the chief press-builder
in the United States, made some improvements in the old
press, one of which was the substitution of an iron bed for the
stone one before in use.</p>

<p>About the year 1800, <span class="smcap">Earl Stanhope</span> contrived a press
which obtained much notoriety. It was constructed of iron,
and of a size sufficient to print the whole surface of a sheet,
and such a combined action of levers was applied to the screw
as to make the pull a great deal less laborious to the pressman.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 320px;">
<img src="images/press-columbian.jpg" width="320" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">COLUMBIAN PRESS.</p>
</div>

<p>The Stanhope press, however, was soon surpassed by the
Columbian press, invented by <span class="smcap">George Clymer</span>, of Philadelphia.
Mr. Clymer, as early as 1797, endeavoured to improve
the common wooden press. His next efforts were directed to
the production of an iron press, till finally eminent success was
the result of his labours. In beauty, durability, and power,
as well as facility of pull, the Columbian press stands perhaps
unsurpassed. The power in this press is procured by a long
bar or handle acting upon a combination of exceedingly powerful
levers above the platen; the return of the handle or
levers being effected by means of counterpoises or weights.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
The powerful command which the leverage enables the workman
to exercise is favourable to delicacy and exactness of
printing,—his arm feeling, as it were, through the series of
levers to the very face of the types. The inventor removed
to England in 1817, and introduced the press there, where it
has long been held in high estimation.</p>

<p>In the United States, presses of simpler construction have
displaced the imposing Columbian press,—the first of which
was invented by <span class="smcap">Peter Smith</span>, of New York, and the latest
is <span class="smcap">Samuel Rust’s</span> Washington press, which has secured
general approbation and adoption, as being more simple and
cheaper, if not more effective, than the Columbian press.
Hand-presses are now restricted to country papers of small
circulation, and to book-offices devoted to extra fine printing.</p>

<p>The bed-and-platen power-press invented by <span class="smcap">Isaac Adams</span>,
of Boston, was for a considerable time the only machine-press
capable of producing fine work and exact register.
It will give from six to eight thousand impressions per day.
As the platen rolls off and leaves the bed entirely exposed,
forms can be made ready with great facility. The sheets are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
taken from the feed-board by fingers, and, after being printed,
are laid in a pile by a self-acting sheet-flyer.</p>

<p>The Cylinder
press, which may
be run at a much
higher rate of speed
than the bed-and-platen
machine,
was of earlier invention.
<span class="smcap">Frederick
König</span>, a Saxon,
early in the
present century
turned his attention
to cylinder
printing, and was
so successful that
on November 28,
1814, the London
<cite>Times</cite> announced
the fact that the
number issued on
that day had been
printed by machinery
propelled
by steam. The earliest
suggestion of
a cylinder press is
due, however, to
William Nicholson,
of England, who,
in 1790 took out
a patent for such
a machine, but it
was never perfected.
According to
Mr. Isaiah Thomas,
a Dr. Kinsley, of
Connecticut, afterward produced a press varying somewhat
from Nicholson’s.</p>

<p class="caption">STOP CYLINDER PRESS.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1818, Applegath and Cowper made important improvements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
in König’s press, which greatly enlarged its field of
usefulness. This machine, with various modifications and
improvements, is in general use in Europe and America, for
newspapers of moderate circulation, and even for fine job and
book work, as entirely accurate register can now be secured
on the new cylinder presses of the best makers, such as Hoe
&amp; Co.,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Cottrell &amp; Babcock, Campbell, and others. The stop
cylinder press (the latest improvement) is particularly well
adapted for fine printing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/machine-typerevolving.jpg" width="450" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption">HOE’S TYPE-REVOLVING MACHINE—SIDE VIEW.</p>
</div>

<p>The invention of steam printing presses rendered books
and periodicals so cheap that the progress of knowledge was
amazingly accelerated; and soon the capacity of the cylinder
press proved unequal to the work of printing the enormous
editions of some of the leading newspapers of the world;
and the first successful invention to meet the exigency was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
made by Col. <span class="smcap">Richard M. Hoe</span>, of New York, in the Type-Revolving
Printing Machine, of which we give an engraving.
It is, as its name indicates, on the rotary principle; that
is, the form of type is placed on the surface of a horizontal
revolving cylinder of about four and a half feet in diameter.
The form occupies a segment of only about one-fourth of the
surface of the cylinder, and the remainder is used as an ink-distributing
surface. Around this main cylinder, and parallel
with it, are placed smaller impression cylinders, varying in
number from four to ten, according to the size of the machine.
The large cylinder being put in motion, the form of types is
carried successively to all the impression cylinders, at each
of which a sheet receives the impression of the types as the
form passes. Thus, as many sheets are printed at each revolution
of the main cylinder as there are impression cylinders
around it. One person is required at each impression cylinder
to supply the sheets of paper, which are taken at the
proper moment by fingers or grippers, and after being printed
are carried out by tapes and laid in heaps by means of self-acting
flyers, thereby dispensing with the hands required in
ordinary machines to receive and pile the sheets. The grippers
hold the sheet securely, so that the thinnest newspaper
may be printed without waste.</p>

<p>The ink is contained in a fountain placed beneath the main
cylinder, and is conveyed by means of distributing rollers to
the distributing surface on the main cylinder. This surface
being lower, or less in diameter, than the form of types, passes
by the impression cylinder without touching. For each impression
there are two inking rollers, which receive their
supply of ink from the distributing surface of the main cylinder:
they rise and ink the form as it passes under them, after
which they again fall to the distributing surface.</p>

<p>This press is capable of printing either from type or from
stereotype plates bent to fit the curve of the cylinder. When
type is used, each page of the paper is locked up on a detached
segment of the large cylinder, which constitutes its bed and
chase. The column-rules run parallel with the shaft of the
cylinder, and are consequently straight; while the head, advertising,
and dash rules are in the form of segments of a circle.
The column-rules are in the form of a wedge, with the thin
part directed toward the axis of the cylinder, so as to bind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
type securely. These wedge-shaped column-rules are held
down to the bed by tongues projecting at intervals along their
length, which slide in rebated grooves cut crosswise in the face
of the bed. The spaces in the grooves between the column-rules
are accurately fitted with sliding blocks of metal even
with the surface of the bed, the ends of which blocks are cut
away underneath to receive a projection on the sides of the
tongues of the column-rules. The form of type is locked up
in the bed by means of screws at the foot and sides, by which
the type is held as securely as in the ordinary manner upon a
flat bed,—if not even more so. The speed of these machines
is limited only by the ability of the feeders to supply the sheet.</p>

<p>This machine was first used by the <cite>Public Ledger</cite> of Philadelphia,
and was afterward adopted by the leading newspapers
of that city and New York, as well as of the chief cities of
Great Britain and other countries.</p>

<p>To obtain the best results from the largest size of this press
it was necessary to employ a dozen or more hands to feed and
run it. This expensive feature was largely avoided in a new
machine projected by Mr. <span class="smcap">William Bullock</span>, whose press
was the forerunner of several machines that may be classed
under the general name of Self-feeding or Web Perfecting
Presses.</p>

<h3>THE BULLOCK WEB PERFECTING PRESS.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">This</span> machine is intended for printing on a continuous
roll of dampened paper, which passes between a pair of
cylinders (one of which is an impression cylinder, and the
other a cylinder around which stereotyped plates are bent)
and receives an impression on one side, and the sheet then
goes forward and is printed on the other side while passing
between a second pair of cylinders similar to the first, except
that the impression cylinder is four times the diameter of the
plate cylinder to prevent more effectually the ink from “setting
off.” After being printed, and before delivery, the sheet
is cut off by a fixed serrated cutting blade, the ingenious invention
of Victor Beaumont of New York. A French device
for making flexible papier-maché moulds rendered it possible
to cast the type-plates to fit the printing cylinders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Without this auxiliary, web perfecting presses would have
been useless and impracticable.</p>

<p class="caption">THE BULLOCK SELF-FEEDING PERFECTING PRESS, WITH FOLDER,<br />
WILL FLY THE SHEET FLAT, FOLD IT THREE OR FOUR TIMES AT WILL, OR CUT, FOLD, AND PASTE IT AS FAST AS PRINTED</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Bullock, born in Greene County, New York, was a mechanical
genius, and was the author of many inventions in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
various departments of machinery.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> About the year 1860, he
began to work out the idea of a rotary self-feeding, or web
perfecting press. After making a large working model, which
is still in existence, he adopted a simpler plan, and in 1861
constructed a machine for the <cite>Cincinnati Times</cite>, which was
successfully operated, but it was far from perfect. Three of
these machines were used for a considerable time in the office
of the <cite>Philadelphia Inquirer</cite>.</p>

<p>He continued his efforts, and in 1865 he produced a press
which met his original anticipation, and a company was formed
to manufacture it. In 1867, while setting up a machine for the
<cite>Public Ledger</cite> in Philadelphia, he suffered a serious injury
which terminated his life. More than fifty of the presses are
now in use in the United States. The New York <cite>Herald</cite> press,
printing and cutting two copies at each delivery, is said to produce,
with but three men to attend to it, 30,000 copies per hour.
The New York <cite>Sun</cite> states: “When our seven Bullock Presses
are working, we can turn off, without extravagant assertion,
210,000 copies an hour.” This assertion must be taken with
some grains of allowance. The press is twelve feet long by
five and a half feet wide.</p>

<h3>THE WALTER PERFECTING PRESS.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">The</span> Bullock press was not long allowed to be the only
press for rapid printing from cylindrical stereotype plates
fed by a so-called endless roll of paper. The principle was
applied to a machine constructed in the London <cite>Times</cite> office,
called, after the name of its celebrated proprietor, the Walter
press. This appears to be an effective press, but it seems more
complicated than either the Bullock or Hoe machine, and from
its mode of delivering the sheets, it is excessively noisy. The
New York <cite>Times</cite> was printed on it at the Centennial Exhibition
in Philadelphia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE HOE PERFECTING PRESS.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">The</span> enterprise of R. Hoe &amp; Co., of New York, soon gave
birth to a web perfecting press combined with a folding
machine that answers every requirement.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/press-hoe.jpg" width="400" height="180" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE HOE WEB PERFECTING PRESS.</p>
</div>

<p>The groundwork principle is the same as in other presses
of this kind. The first pair of cylinders over which hangs the
roll of paper consists of one type and one impression cylinder,
and by it the first side of the paper is printed. The second
pair, printing the second side, consists likewise of one type
and one impression cylinder, but the latter is below the former
and is of much greater size, so that the “set off” from the fresh
ink shall not fall continuously on the same surface of blanket.
There is a third pair of cylinders which cuts off the sheet, and
a fourth (in which, however, one cylinder is replaced by a
brace of rollers) gives the first fold and shoots the doubled
sheet in the circular cutter, which slits it into two papers, sending
them on to be folded again separately and delivered in
their respective places in piles at the side of the press; or the
papers are rolled up exactly on the top of each other, six in
number, and flown perfectly on the fly-board.</p>

<p>This machine printed and folded at the rate of more than
28,000 sheets an hour at the Centennial Exhibition, printing
and folding at one time two copies of the Philadelphia <cite>Times</cite>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
It is already in use in a dozen newspaper establishments in
various parts of the world.</p>

<p>All these machines were in operation at the great Centennial
Exhibition in Philadelphia. A fourth press exhibited,—claimed
by its inventor, Mr. A. Campbell of New York, to be
capable of printing much faster than any other,—was set up
too late to prove its capacity by actual test. No press however,
can be made more simple and with fewer parts than this.</p>

<h3>RAILROAD-TICKET PRINTING AND NUMBERING PRESS.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">These</span> presses not only print, but at the same operation
number consecutively, tickets and coupons of every size
and pattern, which are also indented or cut apart by the machines
as fast as printed. Ten local tickets twenty-six inches
in length can be printed at one operation. The average rate
of speed is about fourteen hundred impressions an hour,—equivalent
to fourteen thousand tickets.</p>

but the beautiful

<p>Gordon’s Firefly
press is unique,
and requires a so-called endless card-board, which it prints
and cuts of the required shape as it goes, at the rate of about
ten thousand per hour. This is not in general use; but his
eighth medium, quarto medium, and half medium Franklin
presses, have achieved a high reputation for expedition and
excellent performance. Gordon’s Franklin press has been
reproduced in Europe
under a different

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Book</span> and Newspaper Folders are entitled to a high rank
among modern labour-saving machines. For newspapers
of large circulation and in book establishments they have
become indispensable. The finest books may be folded by
them with accuracy, speed, and economy; and periodicals
can be folded, pasted, and covered at about one-fourth the cost
of hand-folding alone; while the daily folio newspaper can be
folded in two, three, or four folds as fast as the machine press
can print; or an eight-page daily or weekly can be folded
three or four times, and all the pages pasted together at the
back fold, and the head margin trimmed. All these processes
are successfully accomplished by the various machines made
by Chambers, Brother &amp; Co. of Philadelphia. The engraving
given above represents a book-folding machine.</p>

<h3 class="clearnone">SETTING UP A WASHINGTON PRESS.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">All</span> the connecting parts being marked, or indented by
points, if these be observed carefully, the press may be
put together without difficulty.</p>

<p>After setting the frame upon its legs, and putting on the
ribs and bed, lay the platen on the bed, placing under it two
bearers about type high. Then put the springs in their places,
and the nuts over them, and pass the suspending-rods through
them, observing to place the rods so that the number of indentations
on them correspond with those on the platen. Give
the nuts two or three turns, then run in the bed so as to bring
the platen under the rods, and screw them fast to the platen;
after which, put in the bar-handle, standard, and lever, (or
wedge and knees, if a Smith press.) Turn the nuts on the
suspending-rods, so as to compress the springs just enough to
give the platen a quick retrograde motion, observing at the
same time to get the surface of the platen parallel with the
surface of the bed.</p>

<p>After having put the press together and levelled it by means
of a spirit-level, be particular not to raise the end of the ribs
by the gallows, but let it go under rather loose, which will
have a tendency to make the bed slide with more ease on the
ribs.</p>

<h3>SETTING UP THE ROLLER-STAND.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">The</span> roller-stand containing the distributing cylinder should
be regulated to the height of the press, bringing the shelf
or bridge even with the corner irons, and at sufficient distance
from the bed to allow it to run clear; the stand should then be
firmly braced, as the constant turning of the rounce is very
apt to loosen it; meanwhile being cautious to observe that the
rounce, in its revolutions, does not come in contact with the
frame of the tympan when up. The position of the distributing
cylinder should be sufficiently high to allow the two
composition rollers, at least one inch apart, to rest on its top
without danger of touching the shelf or bridge in front. It
is advantageous to nail two narrow strips of sole leather on
the face of the shelf, about eight or ten inches from each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
end, which, acting as bearers, cause the rollers to pass very
smoothly over them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/machine-rollerstand.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ROLLER STAND.</p>
</div>

<p>The roller-handle while in use should lie in a horizontal
position, the back end being supported by a bar of wood or
iron running parallel with the distributing cylinder. There
should be a notch, or hook, about two inches from the end of
the handle, to catch on the wooden supporter, to prevent the
rollers from jumping forward while distributing or changing.
It is also necessary to have a back-board for the end of the
roller to strike against in coming off the form, to prevent the
rollers from falling backward.</p>

<p>The ink-block is placed about five or six inches to the right
of the roller-handle, and about on a level with it. It is furnished
with the ink-slice, and a brayer, or a small roller about
four or five inches long, and of the same circumference with
the larger rollers, being cast in the same mould.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<h3>COMPOSITION ROLLERS.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Put</span> the glue in a bucket or pan, and cover it with water;
let it stand until more than half penetrated with water,
taking care that it shall not soak too long, and then pour it off
and let it remain until it becomes soft, when it will be ready
for the melting kettle. This is a double vessel, like a glue
kettle. Put the soaked glue into the inner vessel, and as much
water in the outer boiler as it will contain when the inner vessel
is placed in it. When the glue is all melted, (if too thick,
add a little water,) the molasses
may be slowly poured into
it, and well mixed with the glue
by frequent stirring. When
properly prepared, the composition
does not require boiling
more than an hour. Too much
boiling candies the molasses,
and the roller, consequently,
will be found to lose its suction
much sooner. In proportioning
the material, much depends
upon the weather and temperature
of the place in which the
rollers are to be used. Eight
pounds of glue to one gallon
of sugar-house molasses, or syrup, is a very good proportion
for summer-time, and four pounds of glue to one gallon
of molasses for winter use. Glue for rollers should be clear
and bright in body, and even in texture, when held up to
the light: it should break short, and with a clear, sharp edge
like glass.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 175px;">
<img src="images/tools-meltingkettle.jpg" width="175" height="200" alt="" />
<p class="caption">MELTING KETTLE.</p>
</div>

<p>For <em>hand-press rollers</em> more molasses should be used, as
they are not subject to so much hard usage as <em>cylinder-press
rollers</em>, and do not require to be as strong; for the more molasses
that can be used the better will be the roller. Before
pouring a roller, the mould should be perfectly clean, and
well oiled with a swab, but not to excess, as too much oil
makes the face of the roller seamy and ragged. The end
pieces should then be oiled, and, together with the cylinder,
placed in the mould, the upper-end piece being very open, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
allow the composition to pass down between the interior of
the mould and the cylinder. The cylinder must be well secured
from rising, before the composition is poured in, by
placing a stick upon the end of it, sufficiently long to reach
above the end of the mould, and be tied down with twine.
The composition should be poured very slowly, and in such
a manner as to cause it to run down only <em>one side</em> of the cylinder,
allowing the air to escape freely up the other.</p>

<p>If the mould is filled at night, the roller may be drawn the
next morning; but it should not be used for at least twenty-four
hours after, except in very cold weather.</p>

<p>To determine when a roller is in order for working, press
the hand gently on it: if the fingers pass smoothly over its
surface, it may be said to be in order; but should it be so
adhesive that the fingers cling to it, it is not sufficiently dry,
and should be exposed to the air.</p>

<p>Rollers should not be washed immediately after use, but
should be put away with the ink on them, as it protects the
surface from the action of the air. When washed and exposed
to the atmosphere for any length of time, they become dry and
skinny. They should be washed about half an hour before
using them. In cleaning a <em>new</em> roller, a little oil rubbed over
it will loosen the ink: and it should be scraped clean with the
back of a case-knife. It should be cleaned in this way for
about one week, when <em>ley</em> may be used. New rollers are
often spoiled by washing them too soon with ley. Benzine
may be substituted for oil; but, owing to its combustible
nature, it is objectionable, as disastrous accidents have ensued
from its use.</p>

<p>Mr. Hansard, an eminent English printer, says, “Take
glue, made from the cuttings of parchment or vellum, fine
green molasses, pure as from the sugar-refiners, and a small
quantity of the substance called Paris-white, and you will
have every ingredient requisite for good composition. The
proportion as follows:—</p>

<ul>
<li>Glue, 2 lbs.</li>
<li>Molasses, 6 lbs.</li>
<li>Paris-white, ½ lb.</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the glue in a little water for a few hours to soak; pour off
the liquid; put the glue over the fire, and when it is dissolved
add the molasses, and let them be well incorporated together
for at least an hour; then, with a very fine sieve, mix the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Paris-white, frequently stirring the composition. In another
hour, or less, it will be fit to pour into the mould.”</p>

<p>Various patented compositions for rollers may now be had
from type-founders.</p>

<h3>COVERING TYMPANS.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Tympans</span> are generally covered with parchment, which
should be of an even thickness, and about two inches and
a half wider and three inches longer than the tympans. Tympans
have been sometimes covered with linen, which, on
account of its evenness, would answer the purpose; but it is
so apt to stretch, that the tympans become slack in a short
time, and bag (as it is termed), and thus slur the impression.
Silk is excellent for fine work.</p>

<p>The pressman spreads as much good paste on the edges of
the skin as will cover the frame of the tympan, which is also
well pasted. He then lays the skin on the inner side of the
frame, with the flesh side to face the type, and draws it regularly,
as tight as possible, on all sides. The part of the skin
that comes on the grooves of the tympan which receive the
point-screws, is cut and wrapped round the inside edge of the
grooves, which admits a free passage for the screws. After
having fastened the skin on the sides of the tympan, he draws
it toward the joints which receive the frisket, and with a knife
cuts across these joints to let them through the skin; he then
puts the frisket-pins through the parchment, and makes that
end of the tympan fast. He next proceeds to the lower joints,
and brings the skin as tight as he can round that part of the
tympan. The point-screws and duck-bill are then put on,
which prevent the skin from starting. The inner tympan, or
drawer, is covered in the same manner. To prevent their
warping when the skin begins to draw, pieces of furniture or
wood of any kind should be placed across the centre till they
are perfectly dry.</p>

<p>The skins are put on either wet or dry: if dry, they should
be afterward well wet, which will make them give somewhat;
but when they dry they will contract, and by this
means will be rendered much tighter than they would be if
put on wet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<h3>WETTING PAPER.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">The</span> size of the wetting-trough should be about two inches
longer and wider than the largest-sized paper, folded, that
is to be wet in it, and about six inches deep. It should have a
cover with hinges on the left side, that the cover may fall over
on that side, and, resting horizontally, serve for a shelf to lay
the paper upon previous to wetting it.</p>

<p>Having received a certain amount of paper from the warehouseman,
the pressman lays one heap on the shelf attached
to the wetting-trough, laying the first token across the heap
with the back of the quires toward his right hand, that he may
know when to turn the token-sheet, and that he may more
readily catch at the back of each quire with that hand, for the
purpose of dipping it. He then places the paper-board with
its breadth before him on his right, on a table, laying a wrapper
or a waste sheet of paper on the board, to prevent soiling the
first sheet of the heap.</p>

<p>He then takes a quire by the centre of the back with his
right hand, and the edge of it in his left, and, closing his hands
a little, that the quire may bend downward between his hands,
he dips the back of the quire into the left-hand side of the
trough, and, relinquishing his hold with the left hand, draws
the quire briskly through the water with his right. As the
quire comes out, he quickly catches the edge of it again in his
left hand, and brings it to the heap, and, by lifting his left
hand, bears the under side of the quire off the paper previously
laid down, till he has placed the quire in an even position;
if the paper be weak and spongy, he draws the quire
through the water quickly; if strong and stubborn, slowly.
To place the quire in an even position, he lays the back of it
exactly upon the open crease of the former, and then lets the
side of the quire in his left hand fall flat down upon the heap,
and, discharging his right hand, brings it to the edge of the
quire, and, with the assistance of his left thumb, still in its
first position, opens or divides either a third or a half of the
quire, according to the quality of the paper; then, spreading
the fingers of his right hand as much as he can through the
length of the quire, turns over his opened division of it upon
his right-hand side of the heap.</p>

<p>A different process must be used in the wetting of drawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
and plate papers. These papers are usually sent in quite flat;
that is, not folded into quires or half-quires. The best method
of wetting these papers is to use a brush, such as is called a
banister brush; and, instead of dipping the paper into the
trough, he lays it on the paper-board by the side of the trough,
and, dipping the brush into the water, he shakes it gently over
the whole surface, to give an equal degree of moisture to all
parts; and then proceeds as before described. The drawing-paper,
being very hard-sized in the making, will require the
brush, and much water, three, four, or even five times a quire;
while the plate-paper should have as little water as it is possible
to give it, so as to cover it all over; and twice a quire will
often be too much. This same mode must also be adopted in
wetting paper of extraordinary dimensions.</p>

<p>Having wet his first token, he doubles down a corner of the
upper sheet of it on his right hand, so that the farther corner
may be a little toward the left of the crease in the middle of
the heap, and the other corner may hang out on the near side
of the heap about an inch and a half. This sheet is called the
<em>token-sheet</em>, being a mark for the pressman, when he is at
work, to show how many tokens of that heap are worked off.</p>

<p>Having wet the whole heap, he lays a wrapper, or waste
sheet of paper, upon it; then, three or four times, takes up as
much water as he can in the hollow of his hand, and throws it
over the waste sheet, to moisten and soak downward into the
wet part of the last division of the quire; after which, he places
in the heap the label which the warehouseman must always
furnish for each heap, and upon which are written the title of
the work and the date of wetting, one-half hanging out so as
to be easily read.</p>

<p>The paper should be pressed for twelve hours, and then
carefully turned by each three or four sheets, so that no lift be
relaid in the same position with respect to the adjoining lift;
at the same time, every fold and wrinkle must be carefully
rubbed out by the action of the hand, so that nothing but a
flat and even surface shall remain; the heap should then be
pressed for about twenty-four hours in a screw-press, and it
will be in good order for working.</p>

<p>The wetting of paper must, in all cases, depend entirely
upon its fabric; and, since the printer has seldom the choice
of the paper, it will require all his skill and patience to adapt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
his labours to the materials upon which he is to work. The
texture of the paper must be suited to the fineness and tenacity
of the ink. To attempt doing fine work upon common
paper is lost labour. A paper to take the best ink must be
made entirely of linen rags, <em>and not bleached by chemicals</em>.
A fine hand-made paper, fabricated a sufficient time to get
properly hardened, and well and equally saturated with size,
so as not to imbibe more water in one part of the dip than in
another, nor resisting the water like a duck’s back, is most
suitable for fine printing.</p>

<p>Machines for wetting paper are now used in most large
printing-offices.</p>

<h3>BLANKETS.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Woollen</span> blankets are unnecessary when a book is
printed from new type. Nothing more should be used
than a sheet or two of paper, as in fine work only the face of
the type should show in the impression. But when the types
or plates are worn and rounded, fine cassimere or broadcloth
should be used in the tympan. In this, as in all matters connected
with artistic typography, the pressman must display
good judgment and discretion.</p>

<h3>MAKING READY A FORM ON A HAND-PRESS.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Before</span> a form is laid on the press, the pressman should
carefully wipe the bottom of the type and the bed perfectly
clean; for, if a particle of sand remain on it, it will cause a
type or two to rise, and not only make a stronger impression,
but probably injure the letters.</p>

<p>An octavo form should be laid on the press with the signature-page
to the left hand, or nearest the platen; a duodecimo,
or its combinations, with the signature at the right hand, or
nearest the tympan. The form should be laid under the centre
of the platen, and properly quoined up. The tympan is then
laid down, and wet if necessary, and paper or blanket put in.
It was formerly customary to wet the tympans for all works,
and even jobs of almost every description; but, since the introduction
of fine printing, and particularly iron presses, the
custom is well-nigh banished, excepting for very heavy forms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
composed with old letter, which, of course, require more softness
to bring them off. After the inner tympan or drawer is
put in, it is fastened with the hooks for that purpose, which
serve to keep it from springing out. The tympan being lifted
up, a sheet of the paper to be worked is folded in quarto, and
the short crease is placed over the middle of the grooves of the
short cross, if it lie in the centre of the form, as in octavo. In
a form of twelves, the paper is folded in thirds, and the long
crease placed in the middle of the long cross, and the short
cross over the grooves. The sheet lying evenly on the form,
the tympan is brought down, and a gentle pull will cause the
paper to adhere, when it should be pasted to the tympan and
fully stretched. The points are next screwed to the tympan,
for large paper short-shanked points being used, and long-shanked
for small paper. In twelves, the points must be
placed at precisely equal distances from the edge of the paper.
In octavo, the off-point may be a little larger than the near
one, as it enables the pressman to detect a turned heap when
working the reiteration or second side.</p>

<p>When a press is continued upon the same work, the quoins
on the off-side of the bed may remain and serve as gauges for
the succeeding forms; for, if the chases are equal in size, the
register will be almost, if not quite, perfect.</p>

<p>The following operations are comprised in the term of
making ready the form:—</p>

<p>1. The frisket should be covered with stout even paper, in
the manner described for putting on parchment, the paper being
carefully placed on the inside of the frame so as to lie close
to the tympan, and to confine the sheet in its place when laid
on for printing. When the paste is dry, the frisket is put on
the tympan, and, after inking the form, an impression pulled
upon it. The frisket is then taken off and laid on a board, or
on the bank, and the impression of the pages cut out with a
sharp knife about a Pica em larger than the page. After being
replaced on the tympan, it is advisable to put a few cords
across, to strengthen the bars of paper, and to keep the sheets
close to the tympan. When the margin is too small to admit
bars of paper, it is necessary to work with cords only.</p>

<p>2. The form should be examined, to see that it is properly
locked up and planed down; that no letters or spaces lie in the
white lines of the form, nor between the lines in leaded matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>3. White pages which occur in a form must not be cut out;
but, if the page be already cut out, a piece of paper must be
pasted on the frisket, to cover the white page in the form, and
a bearer put on to keep the adjoining pages from having too
hard an impression. Some pressmen use reglets, others furniture
cut to a proper height, and a third class adopt cork, which,
from its elasticity, is very useful. Spring bearers, made of
hard paper rolled up, are also employed to guard the sides and
bottoms of light and open pages, when there is an inclination
to slur.</p>

<p>4. The pressman must examine whether the frisket bites;
that is, whether it keeps off the impression from any part of
the pages.</p>

<p>5. He must consider whether the catch of the frisket stands
either too far forward or backward: if forward, he may be much
delayed by its falling down, and, if backward, it will come down
too slowly, and thus retard the progress of the work and not
unfrequently cause the sheet to slip out of its proper place.
He must, therefore, place the catch so that the frisket may stand
a little more than perpendicularly backward, that, when lightly
tossed up, it may just stand, and not come back.</p>

<p>6. He must fit the gallows so that the tympan may stand as
much toward an upright as he can; because it is the sooner
let down upon the form and lifted up again. But yet he must
not place it so upright as to prevent the white sheets of the
paper from lying secure on the tympan.</p>

<p>7. The range of the paper-bank should not stand at right
angles with the bed of the press; but the farther end of the
bank should be placed so that the near side may make an
angle of about seventy-five degrees with the near side of
the bed.</p>

<p>8. The heap of paper should be set on the horse on the near
end of the paper-bank, near the tympan, yet not touching it.
The uppermost or outside sheet should be laid on the bank;
and the pressman then takes four or five quires off his heap,
and shakes them at each end, to loosen the sheets, till he finds
he has sufficiently loosened or hollowed the heap. Then, with
the nail of his right-hand thumb, he draws or slides forward
the upper sheet, and two or three more commonly follow gradually
with it, over the hither edge of the heap, to prepare
those sheets ready for laying on the tympan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>9. He must next pull a <em>revise</em> sheet, which must be sent up
to the overseer for a final revision, and for examining whether
any letters have dropped out of the form in putting it on the
press, &amp;c.</p>

<p>10. While the sheet is undergoing a revision, the pressman
should proceed to <em>make register</em>, if half-sheet-wise, which is
done by pulling a waste sheet, and turning it, (without inking,
as the sheets may afterward be used for <em>slip</em> sheets,) being
particular not to stretch the point-holes in the least, or to draw
the hand along the sheet in leaving it. In making register,
the points must be knocked up or down in such a direction
as will bring the first impression under the last, knocking
the point only half the distance apparent on the sheet. If
register cannot be made with the points, the difficulty must
then be either in the furniture, the length of the pages, or in
the springing of the cross-bars, from the forms being locked
up by careless compositors, who commence at one quarter of
the form, and lock it up tightly, and so go around, instead
of gently tapping it at opposite sides till the whole is equally
tightened. In locking up a form, the quoins at the feet should
be gently struck first, to force up the pages and prevent their
hanging; but, in unlocking, the side quoins must be first
slackened.</p>

<p>Altering the quoins will not make good register, when the
compositor has not made the white exactly equal between all
the sides of the crosses. The pressman, therefore, will ascertain
which side has too much or too little white, and, unlocking
the form, will take out or put in as many leads or reglets
as will make good register.</p>

<h3>PULLING.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">In</span> taking a sheet off the heap, the pressman places himself
almost straight before the near side of the tympan, but
nimbly twists the upper part of his body a little backward
toward the heap, the better to see that he takes but one sheet
off. This he loosens from the rest of the heap by drawing the
back of the nail of his right thumb quickly over the bottom
part of the heap, and, receiving the near end of the sheet with
his left-hand fingers and thumb, catches it by the farther edge
with his right hand, about four inches from the upper corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
of the sheet, and brings it swiftly to the tympan: having the
sheet thus in both his hands, he lays the farther side and two
extreme corners of the sheet down even upon the farther
side and extreme farther corners of the tympan-sheet. In the
reiteration, care should be taken to draw the thumb on the
margin, or between the gutters, to avoid smearing the sheet.
The sheet being properly laid on, he supports it in the centre
by the fingers of the left hand, while his right hand, being
disengaged, is removed to the back of the ear of the frisket, to
bring it down upon the tympan, laying at the same moment
the tympan on the form. He then, with his left hand, grasps
the rounce, and quickly runs the form under the platen; and,
after pulling, he gives a quick and strong pressure upon the
rounce, to run the carriage out again. Letting go the rounce,
he places the fingers of his left hand toward the bottom of the
tympan, to assist the right hand in lifting it up, and also to be
ready to catch the bottom of the sheet when the frisket rises,
which he conveys quickly and gently to the catch: while it is
going up, he slips the thumb of his left hand under the near
lower corner of the sheet, which, with the aid of his two forefingers,
he raises, the right hand at the same time grasping it
at the top in the same manner. Lifting the sheet carefully
and expeditiously off the points, and nimbly twisting about
his body toward the paper-bank, he carries the sheet over the
heap of white paper to the bank, and lays it down upon a
waste sheet or wrapper; but, while it is coming over the
white paper heap, though he has the sheet between both his
forefingers and thumbs, yet he holds it so loosely that it may
move between them as on two centres, as his body twists
about from the side of the tympan toward the side of the
paper-bank.</p>

<p>When the pressman comes to a token sheet, he undoubles
it, and smooths out the crease with the back of the nails of his
right hand, that the face of the letter may print upon smooth
paper; and, being printed off, he folds it again, as before, for
a token-sheet, when he works the reiteration.</p>

<p>Having worked off the white paper of a form of twelves, he
places his right hand under the heap, and, his left hand supporting
the end near him, turns it over on the horse, with the
printed side downward. If the form be octavo, he places his
left hand under the heap, supporting the outside near end with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
his right hand, and turns it one end over the other. All turning
of the paper for reiteration is treated in one of these modes.
In performing this operation, he takes from the heap only as
much at once as he can well handle without disordering the
evenness of the sides of the paper.</p>

<p>Having turned the heap, he proceeds to work it off, as before
described, except that with the left hand he guides the
point-holes over the points, moving the sheet with the right
hand, more or less, to assist him in so doing. The token-sheets,
as he meets with them, he does not fold down again.</p>

<h3>RULES AND REMEDIES FOR PRESSMEN.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">About</span> every five or six sheets a small quantity of ink
should be taken; yet this rule is subject to some variation
from the nature of the work and quality of the ink. A form
of large type or solid matter will require ink to be taken
more frequently, and a light form of small type less frequently.
During the intervals in which the roller-boy is not
employed in brayering out or taking ink, he should be almost
constantly engaged in distributing or changing his rollers.
He should invariably take ink on the back roller, as it will the
sooner be conveyed to the other roller, and, consequently, save
time in distributing. When, through carelessness, too much
ink has been taken, it should be removed by laying a piece
of clean waste paper on one of the rollers, and working it
off till the ink is reduced to the proper quantity.</p>

<p>If letters, quadrates, or furniture rise up and black the
paper, they should be put down, and the quarter locked up
tighter.</p>

<p>If any letters are battered, the quarter they are in must be
unlocked, and perfect ones put in by the compositor.</p>

<p>When bearers become too thin by long working, they should
be replaced by thicker ones.</p>

<p>When the form gets out of register,—which will often happen
by the starting of the quoins which secure the chase,—it must
be immediately put in again, as there can scarcely be a greater
defect in a book than the want of uniformity in this particular.</p>

<p>If picks, produced by bits of paper, composition, or film of
ink and grease or filth, get into the form, they must be removed
with the point of a pin or needle; but if the form is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
much clogged with them, it should be well rubbed over with
clean ley, or taken off and washed: in either case, before the
pressman goes on again, it should be made perfectly dry by
pulling several waste sheets upon it, in order to suck up the
water deposited in the cavities of the letter.</p>

<p>The pressman should accustom himself to look over every
sheet as he takes it off the tympan: he will thus be enabled
not only to observe any want of uniformity in the colour, but
also to detect imperfections which might otherwise escape
notice.</p>

<p>In order to make perfect uniformity in the colour, the
roller-boy should keep his ink well brayered out with the
small roller, in proper quantities for the work in hand, and
also should change his rollers well after taking ink, and at
other times. The rollers are changed by moving the roller-handle
slowly to the right and left, while the crank is being
turned briskly with the left hand.</p>

<p>Torn or stained sheets met with in the course of work are
thrown out and placed under the bank. Creases and wrinkles
will frequently appear in the sheets when the paper has been
carelessly wet: these should be carefully removed by smoothing
them out with the back of the nails of the right hand.</p>

<p>If the frame of the tympan rub against the platen, it will
inevitably cause a slur or mackle: this can easily be remedied
by moving the tympan so as to clear the platen. The joints or
hinges of the tympan should be kept well screwed up, or slurring
will be the consequence. When the thumb-piece of the
frisket is too long, it always produces a slur: this can be prevented
by filing off a part of it. Loose tympans will at all
times slur the work, and great care must therefore be observed
in drawing them perfectly tight. The paper drying at the
edges will also cause a slur: this may be remedied by wetting
the edges frequently with a sponge.</p>

<p>Slurring and mackling will sometimes happen from other
causes: it will be well in such cases to paste corks on the
frisket, or to tie as many cords as possible across it, to keep
the sheet close to the tympan.</p>

<p>The pressman should make the boy roll slowly, or the
rollers will be apt to jump, and cause a <em>friar</em>. To prevent the
rollers from jumping or bounding, bridges or springs made
of thin steel, to reach across the gutters, may be used: these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
springs should taper off at the ends, and having an oblong hole
in each end, through which they may be tacked to the gutter-sticks.
In very open forms, it may be necessary to put bearers
or pieces of reglet where the blank pages occur at the end of
the form, to prevent one end of the roller from falling down
and leaving a friar at the opposite end. This difficulty may
be obviated in a great measure by imposing the form in such
a manner as to bring the blank pages in the centre. This
mode should always be adopted for title-pages and other light
matter.</p>

<p>Before the pressman leaves his work, he covers the heap
of paper by first turning down a sheet like a token-sheet, to
show where he left off, and then putting a quantity of the
worked-off sheets on it, and a paper-board if convenient.
Laying the blanket on the heap after leaving off work is a bad
custom. If the paper be rather dry, it will be well to put
wet wrappers on it, after damping the edges well. If the form
be clean, he puts a sheet of waste paper between the tympan
and frisket, and lays them down on the form; if it be dirty, it
must be rubbed over with clean ley, and several waste sheets
pulled on it, as before directed, to suck the dirty ley out of the
cavities of the letter. On his return to work in the morning,
he takes care to wet the tympan, provided the type be worn.
If there should be any pages in the form particularly open,
the parts of the tympan where they fall must not be wetted.</p>

<h3>THE LEY-TROUGH.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">The</span> form being worked off, it is the pressman’s duty to
wash it clean from every particle of ink, not only for the
cleanly working and well standing of the letter in the subsequent
composing, but to save his own time in making ready
when the same letter gets to press again. Many an hour is
lost from not bestowing a minute or two in thoroughly cleansing
and rinsing the form.</p>

<p>For this purpose, printing-offices are provided with a ley-trough,
suspended on a cross-frame, and swinging by iron
ears fixed somewhat out of the precise centre, so that the
gravity of the trough will cause it to fall in a slanting position
forward. This trough is lined with lead, the top front edge
being guarded from the pitching of the forms by a plate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
iron. The form having been placed in the trough, on its side,
the pressman takes hold of the rim of the chase by the hook,
or instrument for that purpose, and, laying it gently down,
pours the ley upon it, and sluices it by swinging the trough
on its pivots two or three times to and fro; then, taking the
ley-brush, he applies it to the whole form, type, furniture, and
chase; the ley is then let out into a receptacle, and the form
well rinsed with clean water, by swinging the trough as before;
the form is then lifted out, and consigned to the care of
the compositor.</p>

<p>The ley is made of pot or pearl ash, or, what is better, of
concentrated ley. A large earthen jar is usually chosen for
the purpose; a sufficient quantity of ash or concentrated ley
is added to the water to make it bite the tongue sharply in
tasting.</p>

<p>The ley-brush is made large, the hairs close, fine, and long,
in order not to injure the type, while sufficient force is applied
to search every interstice in the letter where the ink can have
insinuated itself.</p>

<h3>MAKING READY ON CYLINDER PRESSES.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Make</span> clean the bed of the press and the impression segment
of the cylinder. Adjust the bearers a trifle above
ordinary type height. See that the impression screws have an
even bearing on the journals, and that the cylinder fairly meets
the bearers. Select a suitable tympan or impression surface.</p>

<p>The tympan may be the India-rubber cloth which is furnished
with the press, a thick woollen lapping cloth or blanket,
several sheets of thick calendered printing paper, or one or
more smooth and hard pasteboards. Each of these materials
has merits not to be found in any other. Upon the proper
selection of the tympan the presswork in great measure depends,
and the pressman should be thus guided in making
choice.</p>

<p><em>A pasteboard tympan</em> is most suitable for wood-cuts, for
perfectly new type, and for the best kinds of presswork. It is
not suitable for miscellaneous work, nor for heavy forms, nor
mixed old and new type. If the overlaying is properly executed,
a pasteboard tympan will enable the pressman to show
a sharper edge and a more delicate impression of the type<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
than can be possible with any other, and it will wear the type
less than any other. But it will require a very tedious and
careful making ready, or it will prove very destructive to type.</p>

<p><em>A woollen blanket</em> is best adapted for old stereotype plates,
for very old type which has been rounded on the edges, for
posters with large wood type, and for all common work which
requires a clear but dull impression. For such work a woollen
blanket will enable the pressman to make ready a form more
quickly than with any other material; but it is injurious to
new type, and incapable of producing a fine and sharp impression.</p>

<p><em>Thick paper</em> is much used for book-work. It also answers
well for script circulars and leaded forms. It will not answer
so well for mixed old and new type, nor for table-work with
unequal heights of brass rule, nor for mixed large and small
type. It will prove most serviceable for the average of light
and fine presswork.</p>

<p><em>The India-rubber cloth</em> combines many good qualities not
found in other tympans: it has something of the density of
the pasteboard, the hardness and evenness of paper, and the
flexibility of the blanket, combined with an elasticity peculiarly
its own. It will compass a greater variety of work than
any other: posters, script circulars, news and book forms,
stereotype plates, and old or new type, can all be well printed
with an India-rubber blanket. When it is intended to make
one tympan answer for all kinds of work, the India-rubber
blanket will be found decidedly superior to all others; but
when very extra presswork is wanted, the tympan must be
specially adapted to the form of type.</p>

<p>There are forms for which none of these tympans are specially
suitable. For such cases careful pressmen combine two
or more together,—as Welsh flannel over rubber, or thin rubber
over pasteboard or under paper. These, however, are
exceptional cases, and are only thus combined when very
good presswork is wanted from imperfect materials. Careful
observation of the <em>quality</em> of the impression given by each
style of tympan will teach a pressman how to combine to the
best advantage. As it requires experience and discrimination,
an arbitrary rule cannot be given.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the material selected, the tympan must
be stretched very tightly over the cylinder. All labour in overlaying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
is but thrown away if this is not carefully attended to.
A rubber or woollen blanket can be secured at one end of the
cylinder by small hooks projecting inward, while it may be
laced tightly with saddler’s thread at the other end; or, by
sewing on that end of the blanket a piece of canvas, it may be
wound tightly around the reel, and kept secure by the pawl
and ratchet.</p>

<p>But paper and pasteboard require a different process,-viz.:
Take a piece of Nonpareil cherry reglet of the full length of
the cylinder. Trim down the paper or pasteboard to the width
of the bed between the bearers, but leave it a little longer
than the impression segment of the cylinder. Then crease the
pasteboard at a uniform distance of half an inch from the narrower
end, and lay this creased part on the flat edge of the
impression segment of the cylinder, under the grippers. Put
the reglet over this, and bring down the clamps hard on the
reglet, so as to bind all securely. When this is done, a thin
web of muslin may be stretched over the whole, in the same
way in which a blanket is laid on, and rolled up tightly, which
will prevent any slipping of the board or of the overlays
pasted on it.</p>

<p>A large poster, or newspaper form, or any large form with
old type, will require a soft roller with much suction. Book-work,
wood-cuts, or fine job-work, will require a harder roller,
with very smooth, elastic, and clinging surface. Coloured inks
are best printed with a still harder roller and with much less
suction. All rollers should be perfectly clean, and free from
cracks or holes. The suitableness of these rollers cannot well
be explained by words: such a knowledge will be best acquired
by observation and experience. It may, however, be
necessary to state that one roller will not answer for all styles
of presswork: the quality of the work, the size and wear of
the type, and the speed of the press, must control the pressman
in his choice.</p>

<p>Posters, with large wood type, require a semi-fluid ink, but
not surcharged with oil. Ordinary news-work requires a better
grade, more tachy, and finely ground. Good book-work
should have a stiffer-bodied ink, soft, smooth, and with little
oil. Job ink, which is made expressly for presswork on dry
paper, should be used only for such work. Book and job inks
are not convertible: an ink for wet paper will not work well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
on dry paper, and <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>. Very fine presswork—such as
wood-cuts, or letter-press upon enamelled paper—calls for an
ink impalpably fine, very stiff, of brilliant colour, and nearly
or absolutely free from oil.</p>

<p>Every job-office should keep four grades of ink,—news,
book, job, and wood-cut. They can be compounded (if no
ink-manufacturer is near) with each other, or reduced with
varnish to suit any form. Good presswork is impossible
without good inks.</p>

<p>Charge the ink-fountain with the ink selected, and keep it
well covered, to protect it from paper dust. Turn down the
screws, and cut off all the ink evenly. When the form is ready,
turn on the ink cautiously, and wait for ten or twelve impressions
before again altering the screws. For small forms and
short numbers of any piece of presswork in coloured ink or
extra ink, a fountain is not necessary. The ink may be applied
with a brayer or palette-knife.</p>

<p>The adjustment of the margin is the next process. Although
type can be printed from any quarter of the bed, it will be
found most judicious to lay all forms close to the back part of
the bed, and equidistant between the bearers. This will secure
a good impression, give a fair average margin to every form,
and allow the full use of the bed for a large form, without
resetting the cylinder. The bed and cylinder travel together,
and the grippers, which bring down the sheet to the form,
should barely lap over the back part of the bed. So long as
the toothed cylinder wheel, and the short toothed rack on the
side of the bed, remain undisturbed, the grippers will always
pass over the bed in exactly the same place. When the grippers
are in this position, (slightly lapping over the back of the
bed,) take measurement of the distance between the back
edge of the bed and the point of one of the nearest grippers.
With a piece of reglet cut a gauge exactly corresponding to
this measurement. Let no form be laid upon the press until
the distance between the type and the edge of the chase tallies
with the gauge. This will prevent the grippers from closing
on the form and crushing the type. If the chase will not admit
of so wide a margin, or if an extra margin is wanted on the
sheet, put a piece of furniture of the extra width behind the
chase: the margin can thus be increased or diminished at
pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>A book form may be locked up in a chase so large, with the
type so far from the edge of the chase, that the grippers will
bring down the sheet in such a position that it will be printed
with the margin all on one side. To remedy this, the cylinder
must be reset. Proceed thus. Remove the screw and washer,
and draw the intermediate wheel out of gear, loosen screws in
the gauge rack, then turn the cylinder to the point required,
connect the intermediate wheel, adjust the gauge rack, and
screw up tight.</p>

<p>The press having been adjusted, next examine the form to
be printed. Not only see that it is gauged correctly, but also
see that it is not locked up too tightly,—that chase, quoins,
letter, and furniture are all level, and lie flat upon the bed.
If the form springs, the quoins must be slackened; if this
loosens the type too much, the justification should be amended.
Make clean the type by rubbing it over with a dry brush. The
rollers are often made foul and the colour of the ink changed
by dust and particles of dirt clinging to the type.</p>

<p>Fasten the form so securely on the bed that it will not be
moved by the action of the cylinder or the rollers. Take a
proof on its own paper, using very little ink. Proceed to
adjust the drop guides so as to bring the sheet exactly in the
right position. Push out the iron tongues at the edge of the
feed-board, and at equal distances from each other, so that
they will equally sustain the paper. Slide the drop guides
along the rod until they fall squarely over the tongues. Set
the side guide so that it will give a true margin in length to
the sheet to be printed. Adjust the grippers so that they will
seize the sheet at proper intervals, making the margin exactly
even by lengthening or shortening the drop guides. Then
take a clean proof <em>on its own paper</em>, exactly in the right position,
before making ready, when it may be shown to the reader.
It frequently happens that an error in the margin, or an imperfection
in the register, is thus noticed; and its timely discovery
and correction before overlaying will save much time and
trouble. A readable proof may be taken before overlaying,
by running through a sheet or two of proof paper. <em>Make
register</em>, if it is a book form, <em>before underlaying</em>.</p>

<p>When every thing has been found correct, then proceed to
regulate the impression. If the type is fair, the proof should
show a decently uniform impression; but if the form is large,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
or if it contains old and new or large and small type, then the
proof will show an uneven impression. To rectify this inequality,
pressmen use many expedients.</p>

<p>1. By lowering the bearers and putting on more impression.
This, of itself, is a very poor way; for it wears down new type
in order to show the face of the old, and invariably produces
thick and coarse presswork.</p>

<p>2. By raising the low type to a proper height with thicknesses
of paper under them, which is called <em>underlaying</em>.</p>

<p>3. By giving additional thickness to the tympan over every
part of the form which shows a weak impression, which is
called <em>overlaying</em>.</p>

<p>It is very rare that any one of these modes will prove sufficient:
all should be used in conjunction. When the larger
part of the proof-sheet shows a weak impression, almost approaching
illegibility, then more impression should be added.
When one side of the proof-sheet shows a weak impression,
while that on the other side is full and clear, then more impression
should be given to the paler side. The impression
should be made decently uniform before any attempt at overlaying
or underlaying. But the bearers should follow the
impression screws, both being raised and lowered together, in
order to secure the type from the unimpeded force of the
impression cylinder. Not only should the bearers be of even
height, but the cylinder shaft should always revolve on a true
level. If the impression screws are carelessly used, and the
bearers are rashly raised and lowered, this even bearing will
soon be lost; the difficulty of obtaining a good impression will
be much increased, and the press will receive a serious injury.
For the same reason, the bearers should never be packed, (by
the addition of cards, as is usual on a hand-press,) for it strains
the cylinder and all its bearings with an irregular resistance.
The bearers should be tampered with even less than the impression
screws. When the impression screws are so set that
the cylinder gives a fair uniform impression, they have done
all that can be expected, and nothing more should be attempted
by them. Sometimes the proof may show that a cut, or a line
of type, or a set of brass rules, are higher than any other material
in the form. But the impression should be set regardless
of this: it will be found quicker and neater to reduce the
impression on one or two such high lines, by cutting <em>out</em> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
tympan-sheet over them, than it would be to underlay and
bring up all other types to such an irregular height. Pitch the
impression so that it will face the larger portion of the type,
and make the less conform to the greater. Those parts which
are high must be cut out of the tympan, and those which are
low should be raised by underlays, and all inequalities regulated
by overlays.</p>

<p>When any part of the form is very low, it will not answer
to attempt facing it with overlays: it must be brought up to
meet the inking rollers as well as the impression cylinder.
When the proof shows low type, cut out the impression of it,
raise the form, and paste it over the feet of the letter. If some
types are high and some are low, make proper distinction, and
carefully avoid increasing the height of any type or rule which
seems to have a full impression. Pursue the same course
when a marked depression appears in the centre, or a dwindling
impression at the edges. Cut out that section which is light,
and affix it to the defective part. If the impression dwindles
in any part, the underlays must be cut of irregular thickness
to suit the tapering off of the impression. Cut out an underlay
from the edge where the impression begins to fade; then
cut another of smaller size where it is utterly illegible; paste
one over the other, laying them carefully in their proper positions,
and then paste them all on the bottom of the form,
where it is needed, taking care to lay the smallest underlay
nearest the bed. This will restore the type to a proper level,
and the next proof should show a uniform impression. The
same plan will answer for a low corner. Use as little paste as
possible, thin and free from lumps. Be careful that the underlays
are laid on smoothly, without fold or wrinkle. Cut all
underlays from a proof; for the proof serves as a guide both
in cutting and in affixing to the form.</p>

<p>Underlaying should not be done to any great extent upon a
cylinder press. It is a valuable means of bringing up an old
line of type, a hollow, or a low corner. The underlays of any
<em>type</em> form should not constitute more than one-fourth of the
surface; if more than this is attempted, they will rarely ever
fail to work up the quadrates and furniture. The action of
the quickly moving cylinder upon a form of type underlaid
with yielding paper, must create a spring and a rocking of all
the materials in the chase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>Of all materials, old stereotype plates need underlays most,
as they are usually very irregular in height. Thin card or
pasteboard will be found preferable to paper for the underlaying
of plates secured on wood bodies. When the plates are
on patent blocks, always underlay between the plate and the
block. Always cut the underlay for a plate less in size than
the faint impression would seem to require. This will allow
for the spring of the plate. If it is cut of full size, the next
impression will disappoint the pressman, by being much harder
at the edges than he intended. Never attempt to build up a
type form to a proper impression entirely or chiefly by underlaying.</p>

<p>Underlays should be put under all large and bold-faced
types when used with much smaller types, so as to raise them
above the level of the others. This is needed to give it closer
rolling, extra supply of ink, and that extra force of impression
to transfer the ink to paper which all large types require.</p>

<p>When the type has been so levelled by underlays that all
parts receive proper bearing from the inking rollers, and when
the cylinder has a corresponding even impression, then overlaying
may be commenced. For ordinary news, posters, or
job-work, overlaying may be entirely unnecessary; the tapes
and fly may be set, and the printing of the form may proceed
without further delay. But fine press-work cannot be done
without overlays. Underlays are chiefly valuable for securing
an even impression; while overlays are indispensable for giving
delicacy and finish to that impression.</p>

<p>To overlay a form properly, the tympan should be covered
with a sheet of thin, smooth, and hard paper, stretched tightly.
Then take a pale impression on the tympan-sheet, and also
run through the press two or three proofs on thin and hard
paper. Examine the proofs carefully on both face and back.
If any brass rules or letters appear too high, cut them out of
the tympan-sheet in one or two thicknesses, as their varying
height may require. Go over the whole proof, examining
every line carefully, and, by cutting out, reduce the impression
of all projecting letters to a uniform standard. For this,
as for all other work on overlays, use a very sharp knife with
a thin point, and cut on a smooth surface, so that there will be
no dragged or torn edge to the cut.</p>

<p>The next step should be to raise the impression of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
parts of the form when the type appears dull or weak. Cut
out carefully, and paste the overlays over the tympan smoothly.
Overlays are worse than useless if they are not laid on firmly
and smoothly, as the slightest bagginess will cause slur or
mackle. If, by accident, the tympan-sheets or overlays should
bag or wrinkle, tear them off, and commence anew.</p>

<p>Cut out and overlay the more prominent parts first; then
try another impression, and from that cut new overlays for
minor defects. Thus proceed until a perfectly smooth and
even impression is obtained.</p>

<p>With common work it will be sufficient to cut overlays in
masses, as pages or parts of pages; but with fine work every
line and letter needs examination, and letters and parts of
single letters are often overlaid by careful pressmen. When
the pressman is expert at making ready, it is not necessary
that he should take a new impression with every successive
set of overlays. Many pressmen take a dozen proofs of a form
on different styles of paper, and proceed to cut out and overlay
on one of the proofs, and finally paste this proof on the
tympan. But this boldness and precision can be acquired only
by long practice. It is better for the young pressman to feel
his way step by step.</p>

<p><i>The Impression.</i>—A diversity of opinion exists among good
printers as to the proper force of the impression: by some a
heavy and solid indentation of the paper is considered necessary;
while others insist that an impression which does not
indent the paper is preferable. But the indentation of the
paper is no test of the force of the impression. A light impression
against a woollen blanket will show more forcibly than a
strong impression against a paper or a pasteboard tympan.</p>

<p>Type is worn out not so much by the <em>direct</em> impression of
the platen or cylinder on the flat face of a form, as by a grinding
or rounding impression on the edges of the type, caused
by the forcing of the tympan between the lines and around
the corners of every letter. Every fount of worn-out type,
whether from cylinder or platen press, has suffered less from
a reduction in height than from a rounding of the edges. When
the type is new and the tympan hard and smooth, the impression
can be made so flat that the type will not round at the
edges, and the impression will not show on the paper. But this
cannot be done with old type or with a soft tympan: the impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
must be regulated to suit the tympan. On fine work, a
rounding impression should be avoided, as it not only destroys
type, but also thickens the hair-line and wears off the ceriphs.</p>

<p>It is not sufficient that the paper should barely meet the
type: there must be sufficient force in the impression to transfer
the ink from type to paper. If there is not sufficient impression,
it will be necessary to carry much ink on the rollers;
and this produces two evils: the type is clogged with ink, and
the form becomes foul; too much ink is transferred to the
paper, which smears and sets off for want of force sufficient to
impress it in the paper. Distinction must be made between a
<em>light</em> and <em>weak</em> impression and a <em>firm</em> and <em>even</em> impression.
The latter should be secured even if the paper is indented;
though that is not always necessary. But a form of old type,
a poster, or other solid form, must have a <em>heavy</em> impression, or
else a very tedious and careful making-ready.</p>

<p><i>To set New Tapes.</i>—Pass the tape around and close to the
cylinder. Lap it over one of the tape pulleys, and then pass
it around the small guide pulley on the shaft above. To increase
its tightness, throw up the guide pulley from the shaft,
and set the binding screw more tightly. All these pulleys are
movable on their shafts, and distance between them may be
altered at pleasure. Let the tapes rest upon the outer margin
of the sheet, and see that the overlays on the tympan over
which the tapes pass are of equal thickness; if not of equal
thickness, the sheet will wrinkle.</p>

<p><i>To set the Fly.</i>—Run through a sheet of the paper to be
printed, and let it run down the fly so far that it is barely held
by the fly pulleys. Then set the cam which works the fly, so
that its point just clears the small friction roller on the shaft,
and it will throw down the sheet correctly. Tighten the spring
according to the size of the sheet, and set the spring crank so
that it will prevent the fly from striking too hard on the table.</p>

<p>It will be seen that good presswork does not depend <em>entirely</em>
upon the press, nor yet upon the workman or the materials.
Nor will a superiority in any one point compensate for a deficiency
in another: the newest type will suffer from a poor
roller, and the most careful making-ready will be of no avail
if poor ink is used. It is necessary that <em>all</em> the materials
should be of the best kind,—that they should be well adapted
to each other, and fitly used. Although a good workman can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
do much with insufficient materials, there are cases where a
neglect to comply with one condition is equal to a neglect
of all.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<h3>FINE HAND-PRESSWORK.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Fine</span> presswork is the art of printing perfect impressions
from the surface of type or engravings in relief: that is,
the subject transferred to paper should be an impression from
the surface, and the surface only, of the types or engraved
lines, of such a tone as to produce all the effect of which the
subject is capable, without either superfluity or deficiency of
colour.</p>

<p>The press ought to be in the best condition; otherwise it
will be impossible to get an equal impression without much
trouble and loss of time. The joints of the tympan should
not have any play, or the correctness of the register will be
affected, and slurs and doubles be caused.</p>

<p>The parchments on the tympans should be thin, and of a
uniform thickness, and stretched on the tympans so as not to
be flaccid. On account of its thinness, smoothness, and uniformity,
silk is probably preferable.</p>

<p>The face of the platen ought to be a true plane, and parallel
to the press-stone, or table.</p>

<p>The advantage of having a good press is unavailing for the
production of fine work if the types are much worn; for it is
impossible to produce a sharp, clear impression when the type
is worn and the fine lines are rounded by much use. In consequence
of this roundness of the letter, it is necessary to use
a thick blanket in the tympan to bring up the type; thus
producing a gross and irregular impression of more than the
surface.</p>

<p>Ink for fine work should be characterized by the following
peculiarities:—</p>

<p>Intenseness of colour.</p>

<p>Impalpability.</p>

<p>Covering the surface perfectly of the type or engraving.</p>

<p>Quitting the surface of the type or engraving when the
paper is pressed on it, and adhering to the paper.</p>

<p>Not smearing after it is printed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>Complete retention of colour.</p>

<p>Ink ought to be reduced to an impalpable smoothness,
either in a mill or on a stone with a muller. This is essential,
as the process gives it the next quality,—that of completely
yet very thinly covering the surface of the type or the lines of
the engraving, and insuring an even and perfect appearance
to the impression on the paper. Another important requisite
is, that the ink shall not only cover the surface of the lines on
the paper printed, but that it shall also quit the face of the
type or engraving and leave it quite clean when the paper is
impressed on it, and attach itself to the paper, so as to give
a perfect impression of the subject represented, without the
colour of the paper appearing through the ink; and that this
peculiarity of quitting the type or engraving and becoming
attached to the paper shall continue the same through any
number of impressions, without any accumulation of ink on
the surface printed from. After having obtained these results,
and when the printing is as perfect as it can be made by workmanship,
something more is requisite,—viz.: that the ink shall
not smear on being slightly rubbed, and that it shall retain
its colour and appearance without spreading at the edges or
tinging the paper.</p>

<p>The rollers should be in good condition; otherwise the
pressman may exert his skill in vain, with a great loss of time
and waste of paper.</p>

<p>The quality of the paper is of great consequence in fine
printing; but it is frequently overlooked by the printer’s
employers, who are apt to pay more attention to a showy
appearance and a low price than to quality.</p>

<p>The best paper for printing on is that which is made of fine
linen rags and moderately sized, without the use of acids in
bleaching, and without being adulterated with cotton rags:
this paper takes water kindly, is easily got into good condition,
receives a good impression, is durable, preserves its
colour, and does not act upon the ink.</p>

<p>The use of cotton rags, the introduction of gypsum into
the manufacture of fine and other papers, the application of
acids and bleaching powders to improve the colour and produce
apparently good paper from an inferior staple,—these
form the grand hinderances to the American printer in his
efforts to equal or excel foreign productions. Hence it is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
works printed in this country are less valued than those from
the English press, which are printed on paper of fine fabric,
made mostly of linen rags, and sufficiently strong to bear a
fine ink.</p>

<p>A pressman should, as a matter of course, be well acquainted
with the entire routine of presswork; in addition to
which, to form his judgment, he should examine the most
splendid productions of the press, and study them as patterns
of workmanship.</p>

<p>In making ready, it must be evident that, when a clear,
sharp impression is wanted, the pressure should be on the
surface only. Of course the tympan ought not to be very soft,
neither should a woollen blanket be used: the most perfect
impression will be obtained when fine thick paper alone is
placed in the tympans; and even of this article but few thicknesses
should be employed.</p>

<p>After an impression is printed, the pressman examines if it
be uniform throughout; if it be,—which is very rarely the
case,—he goes on with the work; if not, he proceeds to overlay,
in order to produce regularity of pressure and of colour
over the whole form. Wherever the impression is weak he
pastes a bit of thin, smooth paper, of the size and shape of the
imperfect part, on the tympan-sheet; he then pulls another
impression, to examine the effect of his overlays, and continues
to add to them where wanted, till the pressure of the
platen is the same in every part and the impression is of a
uniform shade of colour.</p>

<p>If the impression come off too strong in parts, or at the
edges or corners of the pages or on the head-lines, it will be
necessary to cut away the tympan-sheet in those parts, and,
if that does not ease the pressure sufficiently, to cut away the
same parts from one or more of the sheets that are within the
tympans.</p>

<p>It is generally preferable to overlay on a sheet of stout
smooth paper inside the tympan, particularly where the same
press does the whole or great part of the work: this sheet is cut
to fit the interior of the tympan, so as not to slip about, and
has overlays pasted on it where wanted, to bring up the impression
till it is very nearly equal. In all succeeding sheets
it saves the pressman a great deal of time, as he will be certain
that when he pulls a sheet of another form of the same work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
it will be nearly right, and he will only have to place thin overlays
on occasional parts to make the impression perfect.</p>

<p>It is necessary, where short pages occur in a form, to have
bearers to protect their bottom lines and the edges of the adjoining
pages. These may be of double pica reglet, pasted on
the frisket, so as to bear on some part of the furniture or
chase; but bearers made to the height of the types are better,
when they can be used.</p>

<p>It happens occasionally that the tympan causes the paper
to touch the form partially on being turned down, and occasions
slurs. This may occur from the parchment being slack
or the paper being thin and soft. To prevent this inconvenience,
it is customary to roll up a piece of thick paper and
paste it on the frisket adjoining the part. Many pressmen
prefer pieces of cork cut to about the thickness of double pica,
and pasted on the frisket.</p>

<p>In working the white paper, instead of pins stuck into the
tympan, to prevent the paper slipping, a duck’s bill (a tongue
cut in a piece of stout paper) is frequently used: it is pasted to
the tympan at the bottom of the tympan-sheet, and the tongue
projects in front of it; indeed, the tympan-sheet appears to
rest in it. The bottom of each sheet is placed behind this
tongue, which supports it while the tympan is turned down.</p>

<p>The rollers should be kept clean, but should not be too
moist, as this will prevent the ink from distributing equally
over them, and from covering evenly the surface of the types
or engraving; nor should they be too dry, as in that case they
will not dispose of the ink smoothly enough to produce a fine
impression, neither will they retain particles of dirt on their
surface, but it will part with them to the form, thus causing
picks.</p>

<p>The ink ought to be rubbed out thinly and equally on the
ink-block, so that when it is taken it may be diffused smoothly
over the surface of the rollers. It is advisable to keep rubbing
the ink out on the block with the brayer, and to distribute the
roller almost constantly; the continual friction produces a
small degree of warmth, which is of advantage, particularly
in cold weather.</p>

<p>As uniformity of colour is requisite for beauty in printing,
where the form is large the pressman should take ink for
every impression: this may be thought troublesome, but it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
advantageous in producing regularity of colour. It is unpleasant
to see in a fine book two pages that face each other
differing in colour,—the one a full black, surcharged with ink,
the other deficient in quantity and of a gray colour; yet this
must happen when, as is frequently the case, three or four
sheets are printed with one taking of ink.</p>

<p>In fine books, particularly where the paper is large and
heavy and the type large, set-off sheets are used to interleave
the whole impression while working: these remain till the
printed paper is taken down from the poles by the warehouseman.
These set-off sheets are put in when the white paper is
working, and moved from one heap to the other during the
working of the reiteration. They prevent the ink from setting
off from one sheet to another while they are newly printed,
from the weight of the paper.</p>

<p>To secure uniformity of impression, the pull should be so
adjusted in the first instance as to give a proper degree of
pressure on the form when the bar is pulled home; then,
checking the bar, it should be allowed to rest in that position
during a short pause.</p>

<p>It will be perceived that, to produce presswork of a highly
superior character, great expense and much time are required;
and that it is requisite to have a good press in good condition;
to have new types, or types whose faces are not rounded
by wear; to have good rollers in good condition; that the ink
should be strong, of a full black colour, that it will not fade
nor stain the paper, and ground so fine as to be impalpable;
the paper should be of the best quality, made of linen rags,
and not bleached by means of acids or bleaching powders,
which have a tendency to decompose the ink; the rolling
should be carefully and well done; the face of the type should
be completely covered with ink, without any superfluity, so as
to produce a full colour; and the pull should be so regulated
as to have a slow and great pressure, and to pause at its
maximum in order to fix the ink firmly upon the paper.
These particulars observed, with nothing but paper in the
tympans, perfect impressions of the face alone of the type
will be obtained, and a splendid book will be produced in the
best style of printing.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<h3>PRINTING WOOD-CUTS.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">A single</span> block, when imposed in a large chase, may
spring out of the chase while being inked, from the
quantity of furniture about it. A good plan is to impose it in
a job-chase, and to impose this chase in a larger one: this will
cause it to lie flatter on the press and firmer in the rolling, the
large chase being secured firmly on the press by quoins and
the corner irons.</p>

<p>Before pulling the first impression, the workman should
see that the surface of the cut is perfectly clear from particles
of dirt, and that no pin or lump of paste is on the tympan.
He ought then to pull very gently, or he may injure some of
the fine lines of the engraving.</p>

<p>Neither the pressure nor the impression of an engraving on
wood should be uniformly equal: if it be, the effect intended
to be produced by the artist will fail; and, instead of light,
middle tint, and shade, an impression will be produced that
possesses none of them in perfection: some parts will be too
hard and black, while other parts will have neither pressure
nor colour enough, nor any of the mildness of the middle tint,
which ought to pervade a large portion of an engraving, and
on which the eye reposes after viewing the strong lights and
the deep shades.</p>

<p>To produce the desired effect, great nicety and patience are
required in the pressman: a single thickness of thin India
paper, (the best for overlaying,) with the edges scraped down,
is frequently required over very small parts. The overlay
should never be cut at the edges; but, even where great delicacy
of shape is not required, it should be torn into the form
wanted: this reduces the thickness of the edges, and causes
the additional pressure to blend with the surrounding parts
As particular parts of the impression will frequently come
up too strong, and other parts too weak, it will be necessary to
take out from between the tympans a thickness of paper and
add an additional tympan-sheet, cutting away the parts that
come off too hard, and scraping down the edges. Scraping
away half the thickness of a tympan-sheet in small parts that
require to be a little lightened will improve the impression.
The light parts require little pressure; but the depths should
be brought up so as to produce a full and firm impression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>If a block be hollow on the surface, underlaying the hollow
part will bring up the impression better than overlaying it, at
least so nearly that only a thickness or two of paper will be
needed as overlays. If a block be too low, it is better to raise
it to the proper height by underlays than to use overlays; as
the latter act in some measure as blankets, and are pressed
into the interstices, rendering the lines thicker than in the
engraving.</p>

<p>It will be necessary sometimes, when the surface of the
block is very uneven, to tear away parts of the paper in the
tympan, to equalize the impression where it is too hard.</p>

<p>The pressman will find it convenient to pull a few impressions,
while he is making ready, on soiled or damaged India
paper. Out of these he can cut overlays to the precise shape
and size wanted, which are always necessary when great accuracy
is required in overlaying particular portions. He should
be provided with a sharp penknife and a pair of good small
scissors. A fine sharp bodkin and a needle or two, to take
out picks, are also needful; but he should be particularly careful
so to use them that he do no injury. The best way is, to
draw the bodkin or needle point cautiously in the direction of
the lines.</p>

<p>Engravings in vignette form require great attention to
keep the edges light and clear, and in general it is necessary
to scrape away one or two thicknesses of paper in order to
lighten the impression and keep it clean: the edges being
irregular and straggling, they are likely to come off too hard.
Bearers type-high placed beside the block will be found advantageous;
if they cannot be used, pieces of reglet, pasted on
the frisket in the usual way, and taking a bearing on the furniture,
must be substituted; but the high bearer is to be preferred
where it can be adopted. The bearers equalize the
pressure on the surface of the engraving, and protect the
edges from the severity of the pull, which is always injurious
to the delicacy of the external lines. They also render the
subject more manageable, by enabling the pressman to add to
or diminish the pressure on particular parts, so as to produce
the desired effect.</p>

<p>When great delicacy of impression is required in a vignette,
it will be found beneficial, after the engraving is inked, to roll
the extremities with a small roller without ink: this will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
only take away any superfluity of ink, but will prevent picks,
and give lightness and softness to the edges, particularly where
the effect of distance is required.</p>

<p>If the extremities are engraved much lighter than the central
parts, underlays should be pasted on the middle of the block,
which will give a firmer impression to the central parts of the
subject. It would save trouble and aid in getting a good impression
if the block were engraved a little rounded on the
face.</p>

<p>When highly finished engravings on wood are worked
separately, woollen cloth, however fine, should never be used
for blankets, as it causes too much impression; a sheet or
two of hard smooth paper between the tympans is better;
sometimes even a piece of glazed pasteboard is used inside
the outer tympan. The parchments ought to be in good condition,
stretched tight, of a smooth surface, thin, and of regular
thickness, so as to enable the pressman to obtain an impression
as nearly as possible from the surface only of the engraved
lines.</p>

<p>The rollers must be kept in perfect order; and the pressman
should be very particular in taking ink and inking the
block. He ought to use the best ink that can be procured.</p>

<p>When a wood-cut left on the press all night has become
warped, lay it on its face upon the imposing-stone, with a few
thicknesses of damp paper underneath it, and place over it
the flat side of a planer, with sufficient weight upon it: in the
course of a few hours the block will be restored to its original
flatness. This method is preferable to steeping the block in
water; as the steeping swells the lines of the engraving, and,
consequently, affects the impression. To preserve the original
effect of the cut as it came from the hands of the artist, the
block should never be wet with water; and, when it has been
worked in a form with types, it should be taken out before
the form is washed.</p>

<p>To prevent warping during the dinner-hour or the night,
turn the tympan down upon the form, run the carriage in,
and, pulling the bar-handle home, fasten it so that it will
remain in this position during the interim.</p>

<p>However long boxwood may be kept in the log, it will
always twist and warp when cut into slices for engraving, on
account of fresh surfaces being exposed to the air. Large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
blocks may be restored to their flatness in the course of a
night by laying them on a plane surface, with the hollow side
downward, without any weight on them.</p>

<p>A fine engraving on wood should never be brushed over
with ley: the best method is to wipe the ink off with a fine
sponge damped with spirits of turpentine, and, if it get foul in
working, clean it with a soft brush and spirits of turpentine;
then wipe the surface dry and pull two or three impressions
on dry waste paper. Spirits of turpentine take off the ink
quicker, and affect the wood less, than any other article. The
facility with which the block is again brought into a working
state more than compensates for the trifling additional expense
incurred.</p>

<p>When a few proofs only are wanted from a small engraving,
good impressions may be obtained with little trouble on dry
India paper, with about six thicknesses of the same sort of
paper laid over it, and pulled without the tympan. If proofs
are wanted from large ones, it will be found advantageous to
put the India paper for a few minutes into a heap of damp
paper.</p>

<p>To do full justice to an engraving, the pressman should get
a good impression from the engraver and place it before him
as a pattern, and then arrange the overlays, &amp;c. till he produce
a fac-simile in effect. Better still is it for an unpractised
hand to obtain the assistance of the artist at the press-side, to
direct him in making ready the cut.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<h3>CARD PRINTING</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Has</span>, since the introduction of enamelled or polished cards,
made rapid strides toward perfection; the fine absorbing
quality of the enamel, under proper management, producing
the most beautiful results,—in many cases scarcely discernible
from copperplate. A card, to be well printed, requires as
careful treatment as a wood engraving, (see <a href="#Page_280">p. 280</a>,) so far as
making ready is concerned, and in working without blankets
and using the finest ink. Having made a light impression on
the tympan-sheet, place the pins so as to bring the impression
as nearly as possible in the centre of the card, one pin at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
lower side and two at the off side, taking care that the head
of the pin does not come in contact with the types. The impression
should be exceedingly light until properly regulated,—at
no time more than is actually necessary to bring up the
<em>face</em> of the type. Cards are now mostly printed on small
card-machines, at the rate of one, two, and even ten thousand
per hour. All cards should be printed dry.</p>

<p>A small quantity of varnish put on the rollers and well distributed
will prevent the enamel from peeling. The addition
of a little ultramarine blue will beautifully intensify the black
ink used in printing enamelled cards.</p>

<p>The patent extension feed guides, or tympan gauge pins,
shown on <a href="#Page_310">page 310</a>, will be found very convenient and useful.</p>

<h3>GOLD PRINTING.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">The</span> types being made ready for press in the usual manner,
the surface is covered in the ordinary way with gold size
instead of ink, and the impression taken upon the paper. For
a large job, remove only the back from a book of leaf-gold;
for a small one, lay a straight edge across the book, and cut it
through, of the size required, with the point of a sharp penknife.
This must be done before using the size. Slightly wet
the end of the forefinger of the right hand, and, placing the
thumb of that hand on the pile of gold, raise the edge of the
paper with the forefinger sufficiently to dampen it with the
moisture of that finger; then press the moistened edge of the
paper on the gold, and it will adhere sufficiently to enable the
fingers to lift gold and paper together and place it on the impression.
Proceed thus until the size is entirely covered;
gently pat the gold with the balls of the fingers, or any soft,
pliable substance, until it is set; then, with a very soft hat-brush,
remove the superfluous gold, when a clear and beautiful
impression will appear. Its sharpness will depend on
the judgment of the printer in applying the size to the type.</p>

<h3>BRONZE PRINTING</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Is</span> used more extensively than gold printing, being attended
with far less expense in the cost of the material. The
method of printing is the same, except that, instead of laying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
on the gold-leaf, the impression is rubbed over with the
bronze, by dipping a small block, covered with a short, fine
fur, or a small wad of raw cotton, into the powder, and brushing
off the superfluous bronze with a soft brush, as in gold
printing. Bronze can be procured of various colours, and
when laid on with judgment the effect is beautiful. The palest
bronze is best. To produce a finished effect after bronzing,
take finely-powdered soapstone, and apply in the same manner
as bronze.</p>

<h3>PRINTING IN COLOURS.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">When</span> red and
black are to be
printed on the same
sheet,—the same process
being applicable
to all other colours,—the
form is made ready
in the usual way, and
a chalk-line is traced
around the outside of
the chase on the press-bed, to show the exact situation in
which the form must be replaced after having been lifted. The
form is then laid with its face downward on a letter-board
covered with the press-blankets. The words marked in the
proof to be printed red are then forced down, and Nonpareil
reglets nicely fitted into the vacancies, which raise the red lines
and words an equal distance from the other matter. A sheet
of paper is then pasted on the form, to keep the Nonpareil
underlays in their proper places. The form is again laid on the
press, observing the utmost care in placing it in its original
position as indicated by the marks before made on the bed.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/tools-inkstone.jpg" width="200" height="115" alt="" />
<p class="caption">INK STONE AND MULLER.</p>
</div>

<p>It must then be made perfectly fast to the corner irons, as
it is highly important that it remain firm and immovable
during its stay on the press. The frisket (which is covered
with strong paper) is then put on, the form rolled over with
the red ink, and an impression made on it. The red words
are then cut out with a sharp-pointed penknife, with so much
nicety as not to admit the smallest soil on the paper from the
other matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>The red being finished and the form washed, the compositor
unlocks it, (this should be done on the imposing-stone,
as the pressman can easily lay it agreeably to the marks made
on the press,) and draws out the red lines, filling up the space
with quadrates. When this is done, the pressman cuts out the
frisket for the black. An extra pair of points are used to prevent
the black from falling on the red, or, as it is technically
termed, <em>riding</em>. Generally, when a great number is to be
printed, as many forms are used as there are colours to be
printed. Another method of placing the underlays is adopted
for broadsides, &amp;c. with large letter and with but two or three
lines of red. The red lines are taken out on the press, and
underlays are put in, upon which the lines are placed, and the
frisket is cut out as before mentioned.</p>

<p>A more expeditious method can be employed for forms in
which the lines of one colour are not too numerous to be easily
lifted. After the form is ready, and the various colours are
marked on the proof, a skeleton form is made up, with labour-saving
quotation furniture or wood furniture fitted into the
spaces of all the lines except those of the colour to be first
printed. When the first colour is printed, its lines are lifted
from the form, and the spaces filled with furniture, and the lines
for the next colour are set in their proper places and printed;
and so on till the job is completed.</p>

<p>The custom of printing broadsides, &amp;c. with several colours
is so common that ink-makers generally now manufacture
coloured inks; consequently the printer can be supplied without
the delay and labour of making. We give the following
particulars, however, for the benefit of those who wish to prepare
their own colours.</p>

<p>Varnish is the common menstruum adopted for all colours
in printing. Red is the colour generally used with black.
Trieste or English Vermilion, with a small portion of lake,
produces a beautiful red, which should be ground with a
muller on a marble slab till it be perfectly smooth. If it be in
the smallest degree gritty, it clogs the form, and consequently
produces a thick and imperfect impression; no pains should,
therefore, be spared to render it perfectly smooth; it may then
be made to work as clear and free from picks as black. A
cheaper red, but not so brilliant, may be prepared with orange
mineral, rose pink, and red lead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>Prussian blue makes also an excellent colour, but will
require much time and labour to make it perfectly smooth.
It is also ground with the best varnish, but made considerably
thicker, by allowing a greater portion of colour with the same
quantity of varnish than the red; it will then work clear and
free from picks. As this colour dries rather rapidly, the
rollers should be frequently washed.</p>

<p>Other colours may be made,—viz., lake and Indian red,
which produce a deep red; verditure and indigo, for blues;
orpiment, pink, yellow ochre, for yellows; verdigris and green
verditure, for green, &amp;c. All these colours should be ground
with soft varnish, being in themselves driers, or they will
choke up the form. The consistency of the ink must be
governed by the quality of the work to be executed. For a
posting-bill or coarse job, the ink should be very thin, the
proportion of varnish being much greater than required for
fine work. Should the work be a wood-cut, or small type,
the pigment should be made as thick as possible.</p>

<p>The best colours for printing are those of the lightest body
and brightest colour.</p>

<h3>HOW TO USE DRY COLOURS.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">To</span> produce fine qualities of coloured printing inks by mixing
pure dry colours with varnish, the printer will do well
to give heed to the following particulars:—</p>

<p>1. No more should be mixed at a time than will be required
for the job in hand.</p>

<p>2. Coloured inks should be mixed upon a slate or marble
slab, by means of the muller, and never upon an iron or other
metallic table. The table, before mixing, should be thoroughly
clean, and perfectly free from the slightest soil or trace of
other inks.</p>

<p>3. For working coloured inks, the roller should not be too
hard, and should possess a biting, elastic face. When change
of colour is required, it should be cleaned with turpentine,
and a moist sponge passed over the face, allowing a few
minutes for the roller to dry before resuming its use.</p>

<p>For bronze printing, the roller should have a firm face, or
the tenacity of the preparation may destroy it; yet it must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
have sufficient elasticity to deposit the preparation freely and
cleanly on the type.</p>

<p>4. Various shades may be produced by observing the following
directions:—</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="smcap">Bright Pink Ink.</span>—Use carmine or crimson lake.</li>
<li><span class="smcap">Deep Scarlet.</span>—To carmine add a little deep vermilion.</li>
<li><span class="smcap">Bright Red.</span>—To pale vermilion add carmine.</li>
<li><span class="smcap">Deep Lilac.</span>—To cobalt blue add a little carmine.</li>
<li><span class="smcap">Pale Lilac.</span>—To carmine add a little cobalt blue.</li>
<li><span class="smcap">Bright Pale Blue.</span>—Cobalt.</li>
<li><span class="smcap">Deep Bronze Blue.</span>—Chinese.</li>
<li><span class="smcap">Green.</span>—To pale chrome add Chinese blue; any shade can be obtained by increasing or diminishing either colour.</li>
<li><span class="smcap">Emerald Green.</span>—Mix pale chrome with a little Chinese blue, then add the emerald until the tint is satisfactory.</li>
<li><span class="smcap">Amber.</span>—To pale chrome add a little carmine.</li>
<li><span class="smcap">Deep Brown.</span>—Burnt umber, with a little scarlet lake.</li>
<li><span class="smcap">Pale Brown.</span>—Burnt sienna; a rich shade is made by adding a little lake as above.</li>
</ul>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Gold Preparation.</span> Print as with ordinary ink, then
put on the bronze powder with a broad camel-hair brush;
allow the impressions to remain a short time for the preparation
to set, then clean off the superfluous bronze: the impressions
will be much improved if passed through rollers.</p>

<h3>HOW TO MULTIPLY COLOURS.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">A printer</span> who has on hand a stock of yellow, carmine,
blue, and black inks, may produce other colours and
shades by intermixing as follows:—</p>

<table summary="The results of colour mixing">
  <tr>
    <td>Yellow and carmine, mixed, will give</td>
    <td>Vermilion.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Carmine and blue</td>
    <td>Purple.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Blue and black</td>
    <td>Deep blue.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Carmine, yellow, and black</td>
    <td>Brown.</td>

    <td>Bronze green.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Yellow, blue, and black</td>
    <td>Deep green.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Lighter shades may be obtained by adding proper proportions
of white ink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<h3>CONTRAST OF COLOURS.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">It</span> is wrongly supposed that the art of arranging colours so
as to produce the best effects in printing is entirely dependent
on the taste of the operator; for harmony is determined
by fixed natural laws. The increasing demand for
decorative or ornamental work renders it of some importance
to the letter-press printer to make himself acquainted with
these laws; as, without some attention to them, the most elegant
designs of the type founder, and the finest inks that can
be made, may yield but an indifferent, if not a decidedly unpleasing,
result.</p>

<p>The following remarks will be of use to persons to whom
the subject is new; but for a thorough explanation of it they
should refer to Chevreul on <cite>Colours</cite>,—a valuable work in the
French language, which has been translated into English.</p>

<p class="mt15">I. We may, in the first place, consider <span class="smcapuc">WHITE LIGHT</span> as
composed of three primary colours—blue, red, and yellow—duly
blended; these three, in an infinite variety of proportion,
serving to produce all the hues in creation. If we take any
two of these primaries and mix them, we have a <em>secondary</em>
colour. Thus, blue and red form <em>violet</em>, blue and yellow give
<em>green</em>, red and yellow make <em>orange</em>. Each of these secondary
colours harmonizes perfectly with the primary which does not
enter into its composition. Violet, for instance,—itself a mixture
of red and blue,—harmonizes with yellow; green, having
no red in its composition, agrees well with red; orange, in the
same way, forms a perfect contrast with blue. Either of these
contrasts has the effect of mutually brightening the colours
employed; a red and a green, &amp;c. being more beautiful when
placed side by side than when viewed singly. This is termed
the <span class="smcapuc">HARMONY OF CONTRAST OF COLOURS</span>; and a good example
of it is seen in the scarlet geranium, or the holly; the one
showing a light green leaf opposed to a bright red flower, and
the other a deep green leaf with a dark red berry.</p>

<p>The <em>mixing</em> of colours is a very different thing from <em>contrasting</em>
them; for strange as it may seem, although one combination
of the primary colours gives <em>white</em>, yet another
proportion will produce <em>black</em>. While, then, red and green
look beautiful side by side, it does not generally answer to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
print red ink on <em>green paper</em>. The reason is, that as the ink
is slightly transparent, some of the green shows through it,
and appears somewhat black, and thus lowers the brilliance of
the red in the same degree as so much black ink would, if
mixed with it. This remark will apply to orange or yellow on
a blue paper, &amp;c. The darker and fuller the body of colour
used, the less it is affected in this manner.</p>

<p>The most perfect contrasts are those above mentioned,
which are formed by the complementary colours; yet the primaries
blue, red, and yellow also agree well together. But if
such colours as are not in harmony are placed near each other,
the effect is very damaging to their brightness. While red is
made more brilliant by the proximity of green, it is dimmed
and spoiled by placing it next an orange. Neither blue nor
red contrasts well with violet, because the latter contains each
of these colours in its composition. In any case where they
must come into juxtaposition, the unpleasant effect may be
lessened by adding a little of the opposite colour: so, if a
violet is to contrast with red, it will be well to give it a shade
of blue, making it more <em>purple</em>; if, on the other hand, it is to
contrast with blue or green, it should be made <em>redder</em>.</p>

<p class="mt15">II. <span class="smcap">Colours with Black.</span> In all contrasts, the depth of
the colour is an important element, but especially so in such
as are to be affected by the presence of black. In but few
instances will the latter bear the neighbourhood of a very deep
colour to advantage, while it harmonizes with the lighter ones
by contrast of tone. Yellow, from its near approach to white,
should always be worked “full;” orange and green should
also be full, and moderately deep in tone, to contrast with
black. If a blue is employed, it should be light, or it will impoverish
the black and be weakened itself. A very light blue
border, with a broad margin of white between it and the body
of matter enclosed, will give a clean, bright look to black ink,
and whiteness to the paper. A light pink (such as carmine
reduced with flake-white or with clear varnish) is also good;
yet perhaps the preceding is preferable. Dark and heavy
borders are frequently a positive injury to printing, where the
working in a light shade would have secured a good effect;
for the border should always be so far secondary to the matter
enclosed as not to draw off the attention too much to itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p class="mt15">III. <span class="smcap">Colours on Tinted Papers and Tinted Grounds.</span>
Besides the kind of harmony already mentioned, there is another,
which is produced by the contrast of light and dark
shades of the <em>same</em> colour. This might be employed in letter-press
more frequently than it is at present, with some advantage,
as the effects it is capable of yielding are very chaste and
pleasing. In a photograph or an engraving, all the effect is
dependent on difference of tones of one colour; and the beauty
of a wood in summer consists chiefly in the contrast displayed
by a variety of shades of green only. A deep green ink on a
paper of a light tone of the same colour is especially good, if a
heavy letter is used; and indeed in most printing in colours,
full, solid-faced letter should be preferred to outlines or shaded
ones, which are difficult to work, and have at best but an
inferior appearance unless the darkest tones are employed. A
deep blue on a light blue ground, or against a light blue border,
is also good; and without the latter accompaniment it is
not unpleasant on a blue wove writing-paper. To secure the
proper effect, however, the tints should be of the same <em>hue</em>;
that is, if the groundwork is of a bluish green, the colour that
is to be worked upon it should also be a green inclining to
blue; if, on the other hand, the ground is of a yellower green,
the body of ink should also be yellower; and so on. This may
easily be managed by adding a small portion of ink of the
colour required, until the hue is matched.</p>

<p class="mt15">IV. <span class="smcap">Neutral Tints.</span> In selecting borders for the more
chaste description of printing, it is a pretty safe rule to avoid
such as cover much surface, if they are to be worked in any
strong colour or in black. When lighter tints are used, they
will bear extension over a larger surface; and in this case a
pale gray or neutral border will have a beneficial effect on any
body with which it is contrasted, as well as on black itself,
which is purified by its proximity. If the central printing is
in black <em>only</em>, or in black and yellow, a <em>lavender</em> gray may
be substituted for the border. And in any case in which the
central matter is all in one colour, it will improve it to have a
border of gray which is <em>slightly tinged with the complementary
of such colour</em>. Thus, if the body be red, a very small portion
of <em>green</em> may be added to the gray; and so forth.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that in ornamental printing absolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
cleanliness is indispensable. The same roller should
never be used for different colours, even after it has been
washed. Instead of hanging exposed to dust and to the air,
rollers should be kept in a tightly-closed box; and in this
manner they will remain a long time in good order. The tins
of ink should be similarly preserved, and the lids never left
off except at the moment of using from them. These are
small matters; but it is only by patient attention to minute
details that excellence can be attained in printing.</p>

<h3>OILING A PRESS.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Excessive</span> lubrication is wasteful, unclean, and hurtful
to a press. A small quantity of oil should be used at a
time, as a large amount will overrun on the press, and hold the
dust and grit caused by sweeping the floor; these, working into
the journals, will wear the press more than use. The best oil
should be used, whether sperm, lard, or coal. Kerosene may
be used to clean the ways of a press when they have become
gummed by the use of improper oil. Presses should always
be kept scrupulously clean.</p>

<h3>HOW TO TREAT WOOD TYPE.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">To</span> prevent warping, all very large wood type should be set
up on the edge when put away, so that both sides may be
equally exposed to the air. In cleaning it, neither ley nor
water should be employed under any circumstances. Turpentine,
camphene, benzine, or kerosene oil may be used;
but turpentine and camphene are the best. Procure a small,
shallow pan; lay the form flat on a board; pour about six
tablespoonfuls of turpentine into the pan; touch the face of
the brush to the turpentine, and pass it quickly over the form
before it evaporates. Six to eight spoonfuls of fluid will be
found sufficient to clean a large form, if thus used.</p>

<p>When the paper is brought, the warehouseman should at once
compare it with the bill of delivery, and, if right, enter the
quantity immediately into the warehouse book. The number
of printed copies delivered to the binder or publisher should
also be entered, and his signature be taken at the time of
delivery. This plan will prevent disputes with the bookseller
or author relative to the receipt of paper or the delivery
of sheets.</p>

<p>Having entered the receipt of the paper, the warehouseman
should then write on each bundle, with red chalk, the title of
the book it is to be used for, and remove it into a convenient
part of the warehouse, or into a store-room provided for that
purpose.</p>

<h3>GIVING OUT PAPER TO WET.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">A bundle</span> of paper consists of two reams, or forty quires,
each quire containing twenty-four sheets. Formerly, the
two outside quires were called cassie quires, as they were
mostly made up of torn, stained, wrinkled, or otherwise imperfect
sheets. At present, all the quires are considered good,
although some outer sheets are injured by the twine used in
tying up the bundles.</p>

<p>It is the general custom to print of every work what is
termed an <em>even</em> number,—either 250, 500, 750, 1000, &amp;c. These
quantities are given out for the wetter in <em>tokens</em>,—viz.: for 250
sheets, one token, containing 10 quires 18 sheets; for 500,
two tokens, one 11 quires, and the other 10 quires and a half;
for 750, three tokens, two of them 11 quires each, and the
other 10 quires 6 sheets; and for 1000, four tokens, three of
them 11 quires each, and the other 10 quires. If a work is
printed in half-sheets, it of course requires only half the above
quantities.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to form any positive and invariable
rule for the quantity to be given out for short numbers, as it
must depend in some degree upon the quality of the paper.
The more expensive papers, on which, generally, short numbers
or line copies are printed, must be given out more
sparingly than common paper, and the tympan and register
sheets be supplied by a more common sort, cut to the size of
the finer. For numbers up to 150, on ordinary paper, six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
sheets over will be sufficient. Some publishers are very testy
on this point of allowance for waste.</p>

<p>In giving out paper for what are termed <em>jobs</em>, the amount
necessary can easily be found by a simple calculation in
division.</p>

<p>For example, a job, (label or any thing else,) 750 in number,
32 on a sheet, will require 24 sheets, which will give
an overplus of 18. Where a sheet has to be cut into
many parts, allowance must be made for accidents.
The overplus sheets are allowed for tympan-sheets,
register-sheets, and other incidents, such as bad
sheets, faults committed in rolling, pulling, bad
register, &amp;c.; in any of these casualties, the pressman doubles
the sheet in the middle and lays it across the heap. In laying
out the paper, the warehouseman reverses every other token,
to enable the wetter to distinguish the different tokens. When
this is done, he labels the heap, thus: <i>American Printer, May
10, 1878</i>,—that the pressman may know how long it has been
wet, and the state it is in for working.</p>

<h3>HANGING UP PAPER TO DRY.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">When</span> the paper is worked off and counted, the warehouseman
carries the heap to the drying-room, where
the poles are fixed for the purpose of hanging the sheets upon
to dry, and lays it down on a table of convenient height, with
one end of the heap toward him. He then takes the handle
of the peel in one hand, and lays the top part down upon the
heap, so that the upper edge may reach near the middle of the
sheet; then, with the other hand, he doubles over as much of
the printed paper as he thinks sufficient to hang up at one lift,
which should be about twelve sheets, according to the pole-room
to hang them.</p>

<p>In hanging up the lifts, he places them so that each lift will
lap about an inch over the preceding one. It is necessary,
where the end of the pole is exposed to a strong current of
air from a window, to <em>lock</em> the last lift. This is done by folding
a lift two or three times, so as to concentrate its weight in
a small compass, and hanging this over the last lift near the
window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<h3>TAKING DOWN SHEETS WHEN DRY.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">When</span> the sheets are sufficiently dry, the warehouseman
takes his peel and begins with the last lift hung up, on
account of the wrapper being with that lift, and proceeds in the
reverse order of hanging them up, successively taking them
down, and brushing them, if dusty, till he has finished the
whole.</p>

<p>Another way of taking the sheets down from the poles is,
to lay the flat side of the peel against the edge of that lift
which hangs over the other sheets, and push the peel forward,
forcing them to slide, one lift over another. But by this
method the dust which settles on the sheets while hanging is
rubbed in.</p>

<h3>FILLING IN AND PRESSING SHEETS.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">When</span> the sheets are taken down, the warehouseman
removes them to the warehouse, where they are filled
in between smooth pasteboards made for the purpose. This
operation is generally performed by boys, who, after a little
practice, become exceedingly expert at it. We shall try to
be somewhat minute in our description of this operation. We
will suppose the pasteboards to have sheets between them,
which will be the case after they have been once used. The
warehouse being provided with long tables or benches, secured
to the wall, and a sufficient number of movable tables about
the size of the largest paper, the warehouseman places one of
the small tables endwise against the long one, forming a right
angle, upon which to lay the pressed sheets as they come out
of the boards; the boy then takes his stand at the right side
of the table, with the dry unpressed sheets at his right hand
and the pasteboards at his left, somewhat elevated, leaving
sufficient space before him to fill in the sheets. He then proceeds
as follows. He first moistens the thumb of his right
hand and reaches across to the pasteboards at his left, drawing
one off with his thumb and placing it before him; he then
catches a sheet of the dry paper also with his right hand and
places it as near the centre of the pasteboard as possible;
then, twisting his body nimbly round to the left, he slides the
pressed sheet from the pile of pasteboards to the table at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
left side, and, in resuming his
former position, again draws
off a pasteboard with his thumb;
and so on, till the gross or bundle
is filled. It is then laid
aside, and another bundle filled
and laid across the former, taking
care always to keep the bundles
separated until they are put
in press, when they are separated
by smooth boards made
of cherry or other hard wood.
The bundles being all filled in,
the warehouseman proceeds to
fill up the standing-press, putting
in one bundle at a time and
placing a pressing-board between
them; there should also
be a stout plank introduced
between the top board and the
platen. In case the press should
not hold quite as much as desired,
more may be got in by
unscrewing the press after it
has been once screwed down.
The press is finally screwed
down as tight as possible. It
should remain so for at least twelve hours, when it should be
entirely emptied before the sheets are taken out of the boards.
The sides of the piles or heaps must be kept perfectly even.
In large offices, hydraulic presses are used.</p>

<h3>COUNTING OUT AND PUTTING AWAY SHEETS.</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">When</span> the sheets are taken out, the warehouseman knocks
them up, and, after counting them into quires, ties them
up in wrappers, marking the name of the work and signature
on each bundle. Two or three sheets of each signature should
be laid aside, in case the author, bookseller, or employer
should want a copy of the work or a specimen of as many
sheets as are finished.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">There</span> is no department in the art that is
better provided with means for its efficient
prosecution than job printing. It is true
that an establishment fully provided with
all the old and new conveniences will involve
a very considerable outlay; yet a
beginner in a small way, who has to count
the cost carefully, may avail himself of many
facilities which were unknown a score of
years ago. The smaller the capital, the
more need for the exercise of a wise discretion
in the selection of material. Regard
should be had to the special line of work
to be undertaken, and the type and presses adapted to that
line should be selected. If the master himself shall work with
head and hand, perseveringly and early and late, and shall do
good work at fair prices—never cutting-under to secure a job
at non-paying rates,—and shall be obliging in manner and
punctual in delivery, and shall waste no dimes in drink or
other useless expenses, the growth of his business will be only
a matter of time; and he will gradually be able to order just
what that growth necessitates, until he shall find himself the
proprietor of a well-appointed office and a paying business. In
his first outlay and in all his additions, the best of every kind
should be gotten, if possible, as cheap things always prove dear.</p>

<p>It matters little how well appointed an office may be, there
will be no gains in it unless the proprietor, counting the cost
carefully, makes sure that every job shall pay a reasonable
profit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>When a job is taken in, it should be fully entered in a
volume, giving all particulars in regard to the number of copies,
style, and price. This may serve as a Day Book or Blotter.
A memorandum-slip, like the following, may be filled out for
each job, and kept on file after the work shall have been
completed:—</p>

<p>It will be satisfactory to keep what may be called an Estimate
Book, in which may be entered the particulars of estimates
given for various kinds of work, whether the job be
secured or not, these particulars will be time-saving when a
similar piece of work comes in for estimate. Samples of
paper, of all grades and colours, may be kept in a convenient
receptacle, cut up into various sizes, and with memoranda
written on each sample to denote the cost per ream, the weight,
and the number of pieces in a sheet.</p>

<p>A useful thing to have in a job office is Ames’s Paper and
Card Scale, for fractional sizes, showing the number of pieces
of any required size that can be cut from a sheet without waste,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
with a table giving the number of sheets required to cut 1000
pieces, and another showing the cost of paper by the quire,
sheet, and hundred sheets, at any given price per ream. Besides
the above, we may mention Le Blond’s Chart, a very compact
affair, showing the number of any given size of card that can
be cut out of a card sheet 22 × 28 inches.</p>

<p>The modern printer has every convenience that can be desired
in the way of cases, and his type and other material are
amply provided with receptacles well adapted for each special
use. There are not only large and small cabinets, filled with
job cases of various styles and capacities, but there may be

for indefinite uses. We give representations of these.</p>

<p class="caption">CABINET OF CASES, WITH GALLEY TOP.</p>
</div>

<p>Job type-cases should be kept in cabinets, and not in stand-racks,
as the latter cannot be used without interfering with
the hand whose stand
may contain the case
wanted. Various kinds
of cabinets are shown
on pages <a href="#Page_219">219-221</a>, <a href="#Page_231">231</a>
and <a href="#Page_234">234</a>, some of which
are constructed to hold
cases and quad and
space boxes.</p>

<p>All matter should be
cleared away as soon
as done with. This
work can be done by
careful boys. Standing
galleys, or cabinets with
galley tops, for type to
be kept awhile, will be
found useful and convenient;
but matter preserved
for occasional
future use were better
papered up and labeled
or stored away locked
up in a chase cabinet.
(See <a href="#Page_231">p. 231</a>.) A rack
with sloping boards to
support the forms will
prove to be a safe and convenient place for keeping the forms
of type which need to be held standing.</p>

<p>Labour-saving leads, and slugs, and reglets, cut to varying
lengths, when not in use, should be kept in cases specially
provided for them. And so with labour-saving brass rule,
quotation furniture, rule, etc. It is economical as well as tidy
to have appropriate places for every thing.</p>

<p>For fixed measures, or measures not often changed, the
standard screw composing-sticks are probably the best; but
for jobbing and table-work, where the measure is frequently
altered, it will be well to use the new styles, such as are shown
above; no screw-key or screw-driver being required, the latter
can be quickly and easily set to a new measure.</p>

<p>Imposing Stones may be had with drawers and cases underneath;

when the stone is in use
while imposing or correcting

use, the plain stone with
a single drawer, and without
a rim, will be found
the nicest. When made
otherwise, the rim should
be fitted snugly to the

will become filled with
types, dropped in while
correcting.</p>

in a little water added thereto, and the composition well stirred
until it shows signs of boiling, when it must be removed from
the fire. Add while hot 6 drops of carbolic acid. This is a
very tenacious and durable paste, and may be used on almost
any substance.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>Pastes for Fixing Labels on Glass.</i>—No. 1.—Take of gum-arabic
1 oz., boiling water and glycerine 2 fluid ounces each.
Make a solution.</p>

<p>No. 2.—Take of gum-arabic and powdered gum tragacanth
½ oz. each, water 1½ oz., acetic acid 20 drops. Mix. The
acid is used to prevent chemical change, although a stiff paste
made of tragacanth alone is not inclined to spoil by fermentation.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>To Make a good Mucilage.</i>—The best quality of mucilage is
made by dissolving clear glue in equal volumes of water and
strong vinegar, and adding one-fourth of an equal volume of
alcohol, and a small quantity of a solution of alum in water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
The action of the vinegar is due to the acetic acid which it
contains. This prevents the composition from gelatinizing by
cooling; but the same result may be accomplished by adding
a small quantity of nitric acid. Some of the preparations
offered for sale are merely boiled starch, or flour, mixed with
nitric acid to prevent the gelatinizing.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>Liquid Glue.</i>—Take some good strong glue and mix it with
full proof whisky. Let it digest for three or four days, and it
will be ready for use.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>Strong Mucilage.</i>—The <cite>Journal de Pharmacie</cite> states that
if, to a strong solution of gum-arabic measuring 8⅓ fluid oz.,
a solution of 30 grains of sulphate of aluminium dissolved in
⅔ of an oz. of water be added, a very strong mucilage is
formed, capable of fastening wood together, or mending porcelain
or glass.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>Gum for Backing Labels.</i>—Take any quantity of clear, pure
dextrine and mix it with boiling water until it assumes the
consistency of ordinary mucilage. Apply thinly with a full-bodied,
evenly made, and wide camel’s-hair brush. The paper
should not be too thin or unsized. The preparation will dry
quickly, and adhere when slightly wet.</p>

<p class="smaller"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—No more of the dextrine should be mixed at one time than can be used
at once, as it cannot be remelted easily.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>Mucilage for Postage Stamps, Envelopes, etc.</i>, is composed
of dextrine 2 parts, acetic acid 1 part, alcohol 1 part, water
5 parts.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>Common Prepared Glue.</i>—Dissolve 2 lbs. good common
glue in 3 pints warm water, and add 1 quart of strong vinegar.
Ready to use after twenty-four hours.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>For making Magenta Surface Paper.</i>—1½ oz. of Magenta,
(aniline,) ½ oz. Bismarck brown, (aniline,) 1 cake of glue; put
these into 4 gallons of boiling water. Coat the paper with this,
using an 8-inch double-filled camel’s-hair brush. Quantity
given will coat two reams of double-crown. A hard-sized
paper must be used.</p>

<p><i>Coloured Writing Inks.</i>—The following receipts have been
well tested, and are commended by good authorities as preferable
to the solutions of aniline dyes, which are now so
extensively used as coloured inks:—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Green.</span>—Two parts acetate of copper, one part carbonate
of potash, and eight parts of water. Boil until half evaporated,
and filter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blue.</span>—Three parts Prussian blue, one part oxalic acid, and
thirty parts of water. When dissolved, add one part of gum-arabic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yellow.</span>—One part fine orpiment, well rubbed up with four
parts thick gum water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Red.</span>—With the aid of a gentle heat, dissolve four grains of
carmine in 1 oz. of aqua ammoniæ, and add 6 grains of gum-arabic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gold.</span>—Rub gold leaf, such as is used by bookbinders, with
honey, till it forms a uniform mixture. When the honey has
been washed out with water, the gold powder will settle at the
bottom, and must be mixed with gum water in sufficient
quantity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silver.</span>—Silver leaf treated in precisely the same manner
gives a silver ink. Both these inks may be polished with ivory
when dry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black.</span>—Three ounces crushed gall-nuts, two ounces crystallized
sulphate of iron, two ounces gum-arabic, and twenty-four
ounces water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">White.</span>—Fine French zinc-white, or white lead, rubbed up
with gum water to the proper consistency.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>Fireproof Ink.</i>—Fireproof ink, which can be used either for
writing or printing:—Copal 12 grains, graphite 22 drachms,
sulphate of iron 2 drachms, tincture of nut-galls 2 drachms, and
sulphate of indigo 8 drachms; these are thoroughly mixed and
boiled in water, and the ink so obtained is said to be both fireproof
and insoluble in water. When any other colour than
black is desired, the graphite is replaced by any other mineral
pigment of the required colour.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>Printing Ink Varnish.</i>—Printing ink varnish is made by
adding 4 oz. of boiled linseed or neat’s-foot oil to 6 oz. of
yellow rosin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>Lithographic Transfer Ink.</i>—Three parts gum copal, 5 parts
wax, 5 purified tallow, 4 soap, 5 shellac, 5 mastic, and one-half
part sulphur. The copal is to be melted in a copper vessel,
mixing in a little sweet oil, add the wax and tallow, and when
these are well melted, light the mass and throw in the soap,
well dried and cut in small pieces, then the shellac and mastic.
The flame is to be increased by the addition of the flowers
of sulphur, and so a perfect mixture of the copal with the other
substances will be attained. The flame is to be alternately
kindled and extinguished till the whole mass is reduced to
one-fourth of its former bulk.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>To give dark Printing Inks a Bronze or Changeable Hue.</i>—Take
1½ lb. gum shellac and dissolve it in 1 gallon 95 per
cent. alcohol spirits of cologne for 24 hours; then add 14 oz.
aniline red; let it stand a few hours longer, when it will be
ready for use. Add this to good blue, black, or other dark
inks, as needed, in quantities to suit, when, if carefully done,
they will be found to have a rich bronze or changeable hue.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>An Ink for Marking Tin or Zinc.</i>—An ink composed of
copper one part, dissolved in ten parts nitric acid, ten parts
water being afterward added, is useful for marking on tin
or zinc.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>Quick-drying Preparations for Printers’ Inks to be used on
Bookbinders’ Cases.</i>—1 oz. beeswax, ¼ oz. gum-arabic dissolved
in sufficient acetic acid to make a thin mucilage, ¼ oz.
Brown’s Japan, ½ oz. asphaltum varnish. Incorporate with
1 lb. of wood-cut ink.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>A Dryer.</i>—No. 1, for fine job work. Damar varnish 6 oz.,
bergamot 2 drachms, balsam copaiba 2 drachms, balsam of
fir 3 oz., creosote 1 drachm, copal varnish 1 drachm. To
enough ink for 1000 ordinary business cards, add from 8 to 12
drops of the “Indispensable,” and to larger quantities in proportion.
When used for bronze, dry colours, diamond printing,
etc., take twice the quantity; and where an extra quick dryer
is desired, add a few drops of dissolved gum-arabic to the ink,
after it has been mixed with No. 1. In all cases, mix well with
the ink before applying to the rollers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dryer.</i>—No. 2.—For news and poster ink. Spirits of turpentine
1 qt., balsam copaiba 6 oz. Add a sufficient quantity
to the ink to thin it to a proper consistency for working.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>Silvering Solution for Electrotype Plates.</i>—Nitrate of silver
2 drachms, distilled water 37 drachms. Dissolve and add sal
ammoniac 1 drachm, hypophosphate of soda 4 drachms, precipitated
chalk 4 drachms. Agitate the preparation occasionally
for twelve hours, when it will be ready for use. Apply
with a piece of fine sponge.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>How to coat Electrotypes with Silver.</i>—Electrotypes can be
coated with silver (for working with red ink) in the following
manner: One part copper, 5 parts pure tin; this alloy to be
granulated, not too fine, and mixed with water and cream of
tartar into a paste. To each 200 parts of the granulated alloy
add 1 part oxide silver, the electro is then laid in it, and boiled
for a short time, when it will be found to be beautifully plated.
Fresh oxide must be added from time to time. This coating
is quite equal in durability to silver or tin.</p>

<p><i>How to open a Ball of Twine.</i>—A ball of twine, if opened
from the inside, will run off easily enough and give no trouble
in the untwining; but if begun from the outside, it will speedily
get tangled and knotted.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>To prevent Adhesion.</i>—<span class="smcap">M. Garde</span>, in <cite>l’Imprimerie</cite>, tells
paper-makers how to obviate the inconvenience of the adhesion
together of sized papers, on damping, by the coagulation
of the size. This is effected in the mills, by dipping the sheets
in a solution of alum or tannin. A secondary advantage obtained
is that the paper becomes tougher.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>To detect ground Wood in Paper.</i>—Mix three parts of
strong nitric acid with one part of sulphuric acid: a drop of
this solution will immediately turn paper containing an admixture
of ground wood a brown colour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>French Gold Printing.</i>—French copal varnish 1 oz., mastic
varnish ¼ of an oz.; mix together and add twenty drops
to the black ink table, and distribute; take an impression and
apply, with wool, gold leaf, Dutch metal, or bronze. Apply
the bronze with cotton wool and rub <em>hard</em> over the black ink.
After each fifty printed, wipe off the superfluous gold from the
type with a silk handkerchief.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>Transfer Varnish.</i>—Take equal quantities of fir balsam
and spirits turpentine. Mix, shake well, and set in a warm
place until clear. Used in decalcomania, and for maps, prints,
drawings, and other articles of paper; and also to prepare
tracing papers, and to transfer engravings.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>To make Paper Waterproof.</i>—Dissolve 8 oz. of alum and
3⅓ oz. of white soap in 4 pints of water. In another vessel
dissolve 2 oz. of gum-arabic and 4 oz. of glue in 4 pints of
water. Mix the two solutions and heat them over the fire.
Then immerse the paper, sheet by sheet, in the hot liquid, then
hang them up edgewise to dry, or pass them between heated
cylinders.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>Books Preserved.</i>—The bindings may be preserved from
mildew by brushing them over with the spirits of wine. A
few drops of any perfumed oil will secure libraries from the
consuming effects of mould and damp. Russia leather, which
is perfumed with the tar of the birch tree, never moulds or
sustains injury from damp. The Romans used oil of cedar to
preserve valuable manuscripts. Russia leather covered books
placed in a stationer’s window will destroy flies and other
insects.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>To restore Engravings, etc.</i>—Old engravings, wood-cuts,
or printed matter, that have turned yellow, may be rendered
white by first washing carefully in water containing a little
hyposulphite of soda, and then dipping for a minute in Javelle
water. To prepare the latter, put 4 lbs. bicarbonate of soda
in a kettle over a fire; add 1 gallon of boiling water, and let
it boil for fifteen minutes. Then stir in 1 lb. of pulverized
chloride of lime. When cold, the liquid can be kept in a jug
ready for use.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">A thorough</span> reformation of the orthography of the
English language, desirable as it is, can scarcely be hoped
for in this century; though doubtless the time will come when
an international convention will settle authoritatively the
spelling of every word, as acceptably as has been done by the
Academies of France and Spain in regard to the orthography
of the languages of those countries.</p>

<h3><i><span class="smcapuc">A</span> or <span class="smcapuc">AN</span> before a Vowel or silent <span class="smcapuc">H</span>.</i></h3>

<p>In regard to the use of the indefinite article, Walker’s Dictionary
very judiciously says,—</p>

<p>“This indefinite, and, as it may be called, the <em>euphonic</em>
article, is said by all our grammarians to be used before a
vowel or <i>h</i> mute; but no notice is taken of using <i>a</i> instead of
<i>an</i> before what is called a vowel, as, <i>a useful book</i>, <i>a useful ceremony</i>,
<i>a usurer</i>, &amp;c.; nor is any mention made of its constant
usage before <i>h</i> when it is not mute, if the accent of the word
be on the second syllable, as, <i>an heroic action</i>, <i>an historical
account</i>, &amp;c. This want of accuracy arises from a want of
analyzing the vowels, and not attending sufficiently to the
influence of accent on pronunciation. A proper investigation
of the power of the vowels would have informed our grammarians
that the letter <i>u</i>, when long, is not so properly a
vowel as a semi-consonant, and perfectly equivalent to commencing
<i>y</i>, and that a feeling of this has insensibly influenced
the best speakers to prefix <i>a</i> to it in their conversation, while
a confused idea of the general rule, arising from an ignorance
of the nature of the letters, has generally induced them to
prefix <i>an</i> to it in writing. The same observations are applicable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
to the <i>h</i>. The ear alone tells us that, before <i>heroic</i>, <i>historical</i>,
&amp;c., the <i>an</i> ought invariably to be used; but, by not
discovering that it is the absence of accent on the <i>h</i> that makes
<i>an</i> admissible in these words, we are apt to prefix <i>an</i> to words
where the <i>h</i> is sounded, as, <i>an horse</i>, <i>an house</i>, &amp;c., and thus
set our spoken and written language at variance. The article
<i>a</i> must be used before all words beginning with a consonant,
and before the vowel <i>u</i> when long; and the article <i>an</i> must be
used before all words beginning with a vowel, except long <i>u</i>;
before words beginning with <i>h</i> mute, as, <i>an hour</i>, <i>an heir</i>, &amp;c.;
or before words where the <i>h</i> is not mute, if the accent be on
the second syllable, as, <i>an heroic action</i>, <i>an historical account</i>,
&amp;c.” The few words in our language in which the <i>h</i> is mute
are <i>heir</i>, <i>herb</i>, <i>honest</i>, <i>honour</i>, <i>hospital</i>, <i>hostler</i>, <i>hour</i>, <i>humble</i>,
<i>humour</i>, and their derivatives.</p>

<h3><i><span class="smcapuc">O</span>, or <span class="smcapuc">OH</span>.</i></h3>

<p><i>Oh</i> should be used to express surprise, pain, sorrow, or
anxiety. When the interjection is followed by a proper name,
or as an exclamation of wishing the <i>O</i> should be employed
singly, thus: <i>O mother dear, Jerusalem!</i> <i>O Lord!</i> <i>O that
I might find him.</i></p>

<h3><i><span class="smcapuc">ABLE</span> and <span class="smcapuc">IBLE</span>.</i></h3>

<p>All English words, without regard to the source from which
they have been derived, and those which come from Latin
words ending in <i>abilis</i> or French ones in <i>able</i>, take the termination
<i>able</i> in English, as, <i>procurable</i>, <i>amendable</i>, <i>desirable</i>,
<i>allowable</i>, <i>voidable</i>, <i>available</i>, <i>fordable</i>, <i>incontestable</i>, &amp;c.; but
in words from Latin and French words terminating in <i>ibilis</i>
or <i>ible</i>, then the ending will be <i>ible</i> in English. For instance:
<i>accessible</i>, <i>sensible</i>, <i>defensible</i>, <i>convertible</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In words ending in <i>ce</i> or <i>ge</i>, the final <i>e</i> is preserved before
the termination <i>able</i>, for the purpose of indicating the soft
sound of the consonant, as in <i>marriageable</i>, <i>chargeable</i>, <i>traceable</i>,
<i>serviceable</i>, &amp;c.; but before the ending <i>ible</i> the final <i>e</i> of
the primitive disappears, and there is no <i>e</i> before the termination.
Examples: <i>deducible</i>, <i>reducible</i>, <i>frangible</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The following list of words in <i>ible</i> is here added; all others
end in <i>able</i>:—</p>

<h3><i><span class="smcapuc">IM</span> or <span class="smcapuc">IN</span>, and <span class="smcapuc">EM</span> or <span class="smcapuc">EN</span>.</i></h3>

<p>The prefix <i>in</i> is from the Latin, and that of <i>en</i> from the
French and Greek. <i>In</i> generally signifies <i>situation</i>, and <i>en</i>
mostly expresses <i>action</i>. Hence, perhaps, in strictness, <i>inclose</i>
will signify “to close in,” and <i>enclose</i>, “to make close.” So,
to <i>inquire</i> will be “to seek <i>in</i>, or to search in,” and <i>enquire</i>, to
“make search.” <i>Immigrate</i>, “to pass into;” <i>emigrate</i>, “to go
out of.” But this distinction is not attended to by writers, and
is, indeed, too refined for general practice.</p>

<p>Before the letters <i>b</i> and <i>p</i>, <i>en</i> becomes <i>em</i>, as in <i>embattle</i>,
<i>empower</i>; and <i>in</i> before some letters becomes <i>ig</i>, <i>il</i>, <i>im</i>, or <i>ir</i>,
as in <i>ignoble</i>, <i>illegal</i>, <i>improper</i>, <i>irresolute</i>.</p>

<p>We give a list of those generally spelt with <i>im</i> or <i>in</i>; leaving
it to be inferred that the rest are more usual with <i>em</i> or <i>en</i>.</p>

<h3><i><span class="smcapuc">IN</span> and <span class="smcapuc">UN</span>.</i></h3>

<p><i>In</i>, as a prefix, also marks <i>negation</i>: it is probable that it
came from the Romans. <i>Un</i>, as a prefix, is synonymous with
<i>in</i>: it is of Saxon origin, and generally joined to words from
a northern source; while <i>in</i> is oftener applied to those of Latin
derivation.</p>

<h3><i><span class="smcapuc">ISE</span> and <span class="smcapuc">IZE</span>.</i></h3>

<p>The variation in the terminations <i>ise</i> and <i>ize</i> is due to the
different derivations of words,—<i>ize</i> characterizing words from
the Greek and Latin, and <i>ise</i> from the French. The rule, however,
is not inflexible. The following words are commonly
spelled with the <i>s</i>.</p>

<h3><i><span class="smcapuc">OR</span> and <span class="smcapuc">OUR</span>.</i></h3>

<p>The ending <i>our</i> was in general use until the appearance of
Webster’s Dictionary, in which the <i>u</i> was dropped in words
terminating with <i>our</i>. This innovation has steadily gained
ground. We do not approve of partial tinkerings with English
orthography; and, until a general convention of British and
American scholars settle the method of spelling English
words, we shall adhere to the established usage. We append
a list of words terminating in <i>our</i>.</p>

<h3><i><span class="smcapuc">FARTHER</span> and <span class="smcapuc">FURTHER</span>.</i></h3>

<p><i>Farther</i> is nowadays only employed when speaking of <i>distance</i>;
in all other acceptations of the word, <i>further</i> is generally
adopted.</p>

<h3><i><span class="smcapuc">PEAS</span> and <span class="smcapuc">PEASE</span>.</i></h3>

<p>There are scarcely any words in which a mistake is more
frequently made than in <i>peas</i> and <i>pease</i>. Yet the distinction
between them is simple and well defined. <i>Peas</i> is the plural
of <i>pea</i>, and, consequently, only follows <i>numeral</i> adjectives;
as, “<i>ten</i> peas,” “a <i>hundred</i> peas,” “a <i>few</i> peas,” “<i>many</i> peas;”
but <i>pease</i> is used when speaking of the legumen in the aggregate,
or generally. Thus, we correctly say, “<i>Pease</i> are dear
this year,” “<i>Pease</i> were plentifully supplied to the horses,” &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Pease</i> is also employed adjectively; as, “<i>pease</i>-pudding,”
“<i>pease</i>-soup,” or “<i>pea</i>-soup,” &amp;c.</p>

<h3><i>The Omission of <span class="smcapuc">S</span> in the Possessive Case.</i></h3>

<p>It is not uncommon with some persons to omit the <i>s</i> after
the apostrophe in the possessive case of nouns, if the name
itself ends in <i>s</i>; as, “<i>James’</i> book,” “<i>Barnes’</i> Notes.” But
this is incorrect; for if we ask, Whose book? we should
directly answer, <i>James’s</i>. The only case when the <i>s</i> can be
judiciously omitted, and this solely to avoid the too hissing
sound of so many <i>s</i>’s in succession, is when the first word
ends with the sound of <i>s</i> in its last two syllables, and the next
word begins with <i>s</i>; as in <i>Misses’</i> spectacles, <i>righteousness’</i>
sake, <i>conscience’</i> sake.</p>

<h3><i>Formation of the Plurals of Words compounded of a Noun
and an Adjective.</i></h3>

<p>Adjectives have no plural number. Therefore, in a word
compounded of a noun and an adjective, the <i>s</i> denoting the
plural number is attached to the end of the noun, as follows:—</p>

<div class="smaller">

<table summary="Singular and plural examples">
  <tr>
    <td>Governor-general</td>
    <td>Governors-general.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Attorney-general</td>
    <td>Attorneys-general.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Court-martial</td>
    <td>Courts-martial.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

</div>

<p>But where the adjective is taken substantively, the mark of
the plural will properly follow it. For example: <i>Brigadier-generals</i>,
<i>major-generals</i>, <i>lieutenant-generals</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>Words compounded of a noun and the adjective <i>full</i> form
their plurals thus: <i>spoonfuls</i>, <i>cupfuls</i>, <i>bucketfuls</i>, <i>handfuls</i>,
<i>mouthfuls</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Pointing of Numbers, Weights, Measures, &amp;c.</i></h3>

<p>No comma should be placed between the constituent parts
of the same number, however long it may be. Thus, we say,
“One million one hundred thousand five hundred and twenty-one,”
without any interpunction. The reason is, that there is
no more than <i>one</i> numerical aggregate intended, or but <i>one</i>
complex notion; and, consequently, no separation of parts or
members can take place. The same reasoning holds good as
respects <i>values</i>, <i>weights</i>, &amp;c. For instance, when we say, “Six
dollars and ten cents,” we merely mean that aggregate amount,
but not necessarily any one of the coins indicated. If we did
so intend, then two commas should be introduced,—one after
“dollars,” and the other after “cents.” In like manner we
should act with such sentences as, “Five tons three hundredweight
two quarters and fifteen pounds;” or, “Ten acres four
roods and twenty-seven perches;” and for the same reason:
no division of parts is intended, but merely one aggregate
amount.</p>

<p>When figures are used to express amounts, a comma should
not be inserted to cut off the tens unless the sum requires five
figures: <i>e.g.</i> $10,600, 20,000 men, &amp;c. In column matter this
rule will not apply.</p>

<h3><i>Derivation of English Words.</i></h3>

<p>Of course the Saxon forms the basis of our language in its
essential parts, and is the source whence we derive the greater
part of our ordinary and most emphatic words. Nevertheless,
various other languages have been put under contribution,
especially the French, Latin, and Greek. This will be evident
from the following statement of derivations, which will show
the unlearned reader how important it is to him that he should
acquire some knowledge of those languages, if he desires to
attain to a thorough proficiency in his business as an educated
printer.</p>

<p class="mt15">I. From the Greek are derived—</p>

<p>1. Words ending in <i>gram</i>, <i>graph</i>, and <i>graphy</i>; as, <i>telegram</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
<i>telegraph</i>, <i>geography</i>, &amp;c.; from the word γράφω, (<i>grapho</i>,)
I write, and some other Greek word.</p>

<p>2. Those in <i>gon</i>; from γωνια, (<i>gonia</i>,) an angle; as, <i>octagon</i>.</p>

<p>3. All words in <i>logue</i> or <i>logy</i>; as, <i>epilogue</i>, <i>astrology</i>; from
λόγος, (<i>logos</i>,) a discourse.</p>

<p>4. <i>Ic</i>, <i>ick</i>, <i>ics</i> are also Greek terminations, generally of
adjectives.</p>

<p>5. Words in <i>meter</i> are all of Greek origin, coming from the
verb μετρῶ, (<i>metro</i>,) I measure, in combination with some other
word.</p>

<p>6. Most words into which the terminations <i>agogue</i>, <i>asis</i>,
<i>esis</i>, or <i>ysis</i> enter are also of Greek origin; such as <i>demagogue</i>,
<i>emphasis</i>, <i>parenthesis</i>, <i>analysis</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="mt15">II. But the main source whence we have derived words,
with the exception of the Saxon, is the Latin, as will appear
from an inspection of the following list:—</p>

<p>1. Words ending in <i>ance</i>, <i>ancy</i>, or <i>ant</i>, and <i>ence</i>, <i>ency</i>, or <i>ent</i>,
come from Latin words ending respectively in <i>ans</i>, <i>antia</i>, or
<i>ens</i>, <i>entia</i>; as, <i>abundance</i>, from <i lang="la">abundantia</i>; <i>infancy</i>, from <i lang="la">infantia</i>;
<i>abundant</i>, from <i lang="la">abundans</i>; <i>absence</i>, from <i lang="la">absentia</i>;
<i>excellency</i>, from <i lang="la">excellentia</i>; and <i>excellent</i>, from <i lang="la">excellens</i>.</p>

<p>2. Words in <i>al</i> have their Latin representatives in <i lang="la">alis</i>; as,
<i>corporal</i>, from <i lang="la">corporalis</i>.</p>

<p>3. Verbs in <i>ate</i> mostly come from Latin verbs of the first
conjugation; as, <i>moderate</i>, from <i lang="la">modero</i>.</p>

<p>4. Words in <i>ator</i> are generally the same in both languages;
as, <i>orator</i>, <i>senator</i>, <i>moderator</i>.</p>

<p>5. The termination <i>id</i> comes mostly from Latin words ending
in <i>idus</i>; as, <i>acid</i>, from <i lang="la">acidus</i>; but sometimes words of this
ending are of Greek origin; as, <i>oxide</i>, (more correctly, <i>oxyd</i>,)
from ὀξὺς, (<i>oxys</i>;) and, indeed, most scientific words of this ending;
as, <i>carotid</i>, from καρώτιδες, &amp;c.; <i>rhomboid</i>, from ῥομβοειδής.</p>

<p>6. <i>Il</i> or <i>ile</i> is likewise from the Latin termination of adjectives
in <i>ilis</i>; as, <i>docile</i>, from <i lang="la">docilis</i>; <i>civil</i>, from <i lang="la">civilis</i>.</p>

<p>7. The Latin termination <i>osus</i> has its English representative
in <i>ious</i> or <i>ous</i>; as, <i>copious</i>, from <i lang="la">copiosus</i>; <i>numerous</i>,
from <i lang="la">numerosus</i>. But sometimes the English ending <i>ous</i>
comes from a Latin word in <i>ax</i>; as, <i>capacious</i>, from <i lang="la">capax</i>.</p>

<p>8. The Latin ending <i>io</i> has its English corresponding word
in <i>ion</i>; as, <i>nation</i>, from <i lang="la">natio</i>; <i>oration</i>, from <i lang="la">oratio</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>9. The endings <i>ne</i>, <i>re</i>, and <i>te</i> after a vowel are also for the
greater part of Latin origin; as, <i>fortune</i>, from <i lang="la">fortuna</i>; <i>aquiline</i>,
from <i lang="la">aquilinus</i>; <i>culture</i>, from <i lang="la">cultura</i>; <i>pure</i>, from <i lang="la">purus</i>;
<i>complete</i>, from <i lang="la">completus</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>10. Words in <i>ty</i> come from Latin words in <i>tas</i>; as, <i>equality</i>,
from <i lang="la">æqualitas</i>; <i>bounty</i>, from <i lang="la">bonitas</i>; <i>rarity</i>, from <i lang="la">raritas</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>11. The termination <i>ude</i> is also of Latin origin, coming
from words in <i>udo</i>; as, <i>fortitude</i>, from <i lang="la">fortitudo</i>; <i>elude</i>, from
<i lang="la">eludo</i>.</p>

<p>12. So also is <i>uous</i>, by inserting the letter <i>o</i>; as, <i>ambiguous</i>,
from <i lang="la">ambiguus</i>; <i>continuous</i>, from <i lang="la">continuus</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="mt15">III. From the French have come—</p>

<p>1. Most of our words in <i>age</i>; as, <i>page</i>, <i>rage</i>, <i>usage</i>.</p>

<p>2. All those in <i>eau</i>; as, <i>beau</i>, <i>flambeau</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. The French <i lang="fr">esse</i> is represented by the English <i>ess</i>: as,
<i>princess</i>, from <i lang="fr">princesse</i>.</p>

<p>4. Words in <i>que</i> mostly come to us from the French directly;
some from the Latin directly or indirectly; as, <i>antique</i>, (L. <i lang="la">antiquus</i>,
F. <i lang="fr">antique</i>,) <i>oblique</i>, <i>opaque</i>.</p>

<p>5. Words ending in <i>ment</i> are nearly the same in both languages;
as, <i>commencement</i>, <i>advancement</i>, (F. <i lang="fr">avancement</i>,) &amp;c.</p>

<cite>American Pronouncing Dictionary</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></h3>

<h4>RULE I.</h4>

<p>Words ending in silent <i>e</i> after <i>u</i> or a consonant generally
drop the <i>e</i> on taking an additional termination beginning with
a vowel; as, sale, <i>salable</i>; plague, <i>plaguy</i>; sue, <i>suing</i>; eye,
<i>eying</i>.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="smcap">Exception I.</span>—Words ending in <i>ce</i> and <i>ge</i> retain <i>e</i> before <i>able</i> and <i>ous</i>; as, service,
<i>serviceable</i>; trace, <i>traceable</i>; courage, <i>courageous</i>; advantage, <i>advantageous</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Exception II.</span>—Compounds and prefixes retain <i>e</i>; as, <i>firearms</i>, <i>foreordain</i>,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Remark.</i>—From singe, springe, swinge, tinge, we write <i>singeing</i>, <i>springeing</i>,
<i>swingeing</i>, <i>tingeing</i>, to distinguish from <i>singing</i>, <i>springing</i>, <i>swinging</i>, and <i>tinging</i>.
<i>Dyeing</i>, from dye, retains <i>e</i>, to distinguish it from <i>dying</i>, the present participle of
die. Mile retains <i>e</i> in <i>mileage</i>. Derivatives from proper names of persons retain <i>e</i>;
as, <i>daguerreotype</i>, <i>morseograph</i>.</p>

</div>

<h4>RULE II.</h4>

<p>Words ending in silent <i>e</i> generally retain the <i>e</i> on taking
an additional termination beginning with a consonant; as,
bereave, <i>bereavement</i>; issue, <i>issueless</i>.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><i>Remark.</i>—<i>Awful</i>, <i>awfully</i>, <i>awfulness</i>, <i>argument</i>, <i>argumentation</i>, <i>argumentative</i>,
<i>woful</i>, <i>wofully</i>, <i>wofulness</i>, <i>duly</i>, <i>truly</i>, and <i>wholly</i>, are undisputed exceptions;
and <i>abridgment</i>, <i>acknowledgment</i>, <i>judgment</i>, <i>misjudgment</i>, <i>prejudgment</i>, <i>lodgment</i>,
<i>wobegone</i>, and <i>rhymster</i>, are disputed exceptions. Some write <i>abridgement</i>,
<i>acknowledgement</i>, <i>judgement</i>, <i>misjudgement</i>, <i>prejudgement</i>, <i>lodgement</i>, <i>woebegone</i>,
and <i>rhymester</i>.</p>

</div>

<h4>RULE III.</h4>

<p>Words ending in <i>ie</i> change them into <i>y</i> before <i>ing</i>; as, lie,
<i>lying</i>. The following words conform to this rule:—</p>

<div class="smaller">

<ul>
<li>lie</li>
<li>belie</li>
<li>outlie</li>
<li>lie</li>
<li>overlie</li>

<li>die</li>
<li>hie</li>
<li>tie</li>
<li>untie</li>
<li>vie</li>
<li>outvie</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h4>RULE IV.</h4>

<p>Words ending in <i>y</i> preceded by a consonant generally
change <i>y</i> into <i>i</i> on taking an additional syllable; as, mercy,
<i>merciful</i>, <i>merciless</i>; defy, <i>defied</i>, <i>defies</i>, <i>defieth</i>, <i>defiant</i>; busy,
<i>busier</i>, <i>busiest</i>, <i>business</i>; ply, <i>pliers</i>; porphyry, <i>porphyritic</i>.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="smcap">Exception I.</span>—<i>Y</i> after a consonant is not changed into <i>i</i> before <i>ing</i> or <i>ish</i>; as,
<i>dry</i>, <i>drying</i>, <i>dryish</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Exception II.</span>—Compounds usually retain <i>y</i>; as, <i>mercy-seat</i>, <i>county-town</i>,
<i>dairy-maid</i>, <i>skylight</i>.</p>

<p><i>Remark.</i>—<i>Dryer</i>, <i>dryest</i>, <i>dryly</i>, <i>dryness</i>, <i>shyer</i>, <i>shyest</i>, <i>shyly</i>, <i>shyness</i>, are undisputed
exceptions to the rule; and <i>slyer</i>, <i>slyest</i>, <i>slyly</i>, <i>slyness</i>, are disputed exceptions.</p>

</div>

<h4>RULE V.</h4>

<p>Words ending in <i>y</i> preceded by a vowel retain the <i>y</i>; as,
gay, <i>gayly</i>, <i>gayness</i>, <i>gayety</i>; pray, <i>prayer</i>, <i>praying</i>, <i>prayed</i>,
<i>prays</i>.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><i>Remark.</i>—From day, lay, pay, say, stay, are formed <i>daily</i>, <i>laid</i>, <i>paid</i>, <i>said</i>,
<i>saith</i>, <i>staid</i>. The regular words <i>dayly</i>, <i>layed</i>, <i>payed</i>, <i>sayeth</i>, and <i>stayed</i>, are
sometimes used.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<h4>RULE VI.</h4>

<p>Monosyllables and words having the primary accent on the
last syllable, when they end with a single consonant preceded
by a single vowel, double their final consonant before an additional
syllable that begins with a vowel; as, wet, <i>wetter</i>,
<i>wettest</i>, <i>wetting</i>, <i>wetted</i>; drum, <i>drumming</i>, <i>drummed</i>; dispel,
<i>dispelling</i>, <i>dispelled</i>.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="smcap">Exception.</span>—A final <i>x</i>, or the <i>s</i> in gas, should not be doubled; as, fix, <i>fixes</i>,
<i>fixed</i>, <i>fixing</i>; annex, <i>annexing</i>; <i>gases</i>, <i>gasefy</i>.</p>

<p><i>Remark I.</i>—<i>U</i> after <i>q</i> is never reckoned a part of a diphthong or triphthong;
so that from quit are formed <i>quitting</i>, <i>quitted</i>; and from quag, <i>quaggy</i>.</p>

<p><i>Remark II.</i>—This rule applies only to derivatives which retain the accent of their
primitives, and not to such as <i>in´ferable</i>, <i>in´ference</i>, <i>pref´erable</i>, <i>pref´erence</i>,
<i>ref´erable</i>, and <i>ref´erence</i>, from infer, prefer, and refer. To the forms <i>infer´rible</i>,
<i>refer´rible</i>, which are sometimes met with, the general rule applies. <i>Transfer´able</i>,
from transfer, is an exception to the general rule; the regular form <i>transfer´rible</i>
is not often used. Although <i>parallel´ogram</i>, from par´allel, and <i>modal´ity</i> from
mo´dal, remove the primary accent to the point of duplication, they do not double the
final <i>l</i>. See Remark II. under Rule VII.</p>

</div>

<h4>RULE VII.</h4>

<p>A final consonant is not doubled when it is preceded by a
diphthong, when the primary accent is either not on, or not
retained upon, the last syllable, or when the additional syllable
begins with a consonant; as, beat, <i>beating</i>, <i>beaten</i>; dif´fer,
<i>dif´fering</i>, <i>dif´fered</i>, <i>dif´ference</i>, <i>dif´ferent</i>; prefer´, <i>pref´erence</i>;
refer´, <i>ref´erence</i>; fit, <i>fitful</i>, <i>fitly</i>, <i>fitness</i>; ben´efit, <i>ben´efited</i>,

making nearly all the derivatives conform to the rule. Webster and Smart accent
the verb <i>curv´et</i>, on the first syllable, with which accentuation <i>curveting</i> and

<p><i>Remark I.</i>—<i>Annul</i>, <i>until</i>, <i>twibil</i>, and the conservative <i>fulfil</i>, or the Websterian
<i>fulfill</i>, are the only exceptions to the first part of this rule extensively recognized
by present usage. The conservative <i>distil</i> and <i>instil</i> are at variance; but the Websterian
<i>distill</i> and <i>instill</i>, and also <i>twibill</i>, as written by Reid, are in harmony
with the rule.</p>

<p><i>Remark II.</i>—<i>Pontific</i>, and all other derivatives of pontiff, are exceptions to the
latter part of this rule, unless an <i>f</i> is discarded in the primitive word, as Webster
suggests and the derivation warrants. The derivatives of dull, full, skill, and will,
are disputed exceptions: if spelled as Webster writes them, <i>dullness</i>, <i>fullness</i>,
<i>skillful</i>, <i>willful</i>, they conform to the rule.</p>

<h4>RULE X.</h4>

<p>The plural is usually formed from the singular by adding <i>s</i>;
as, brave, <i>braves</i>; night, <i>nights</i>; hymn, <i>hymns</i>.</p>

<h2 id="HOW_TO_SECURE_COPYRIGHTS">HOW TO SECURE COPYRIGHTS.</h2>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>1. A <em>printed</em> copy of the title (besides the two copies to be
deposited after publication) of the book, map, chart, dramatic
or musical composition, engraving, cut, print, photograph, or
a <em>description</em> of the painting, drawing, chromo, statue, statuary,
or model or design for a work of the fine arts, for which
copyright is desired, must be sent by mail or otherwise, <em>prepaid</em>,
addressed:</p>

<p class="right"><i><span class="pad2r"><span class="pad2r">Librarian of Congress,</span></span><br />
<span class="pad2r">Washington, D. C.</span></i></p>

<p class="noindent">This must be done before publication of the book or other
article.</p>

<p>The <em>printed title</em> required may be a copy of the title page of
such publications as have title pages. In other cases, the title
must be printed expressly for copyright entry, with name of
claimant of copyright. The style of type is immaterial, and
the print of a type-writer will be accepted. But a separate
title is required for each entry, and <em>each</em> title must be printed
on paper as large as commercial note. The title of a <em>periodical</em>
must include the date and number.</p>

<p>2. A fee of 50 cents, for recording the title of each book or
other article, must be enclosed with the title as above, and 50
cents in addition (or one dollar in all) for each certificate of
copyright under seal of the Librarian of Congress, which will
be transmitted by early mail.</p>

<p>3. Within ten days after publication of each book or other
article, two complete copies of the best edition issued must be
sent, to perfect the copyright, with the address:</p>

<p class="right"><i><span class="pad2r"><span class="pad2r">Librarian of Congress,</span></span><br />
<span class="pad2r">Washington, D. C.</span></i></p>

<p class="noindent">The postage must be prepaid, or else the publications inclosed
in parcels covered by printed Penalty Labels, furnished by the
Librarian, in which case they will come <span class="smcapuc">FREE</span> by mail, according
to rulings of the Post Office Department. Without the
deposit of copies above required the copyright is void, and a
penalty of $25 is incurred. No copy is required to be deposited
elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>4. No copyright is valid unless notice is given by inserting
in every copy published, on the title-page or the page following,
if it be a book; or, if a map, chart, musical composition,
print, cut, engraving, photograph, painting, drawing, chromo,
statue, statuary, or model or design intended to be perfected
as a work of the fine arts, by inscribing upon some portion
thereof, or on the substance on which the same is mounted,
the following words, viz.: “<i>Entered according to act of Congress,
in the year ⸺, by ⸺ ⸺, in the office of the Librarian
of Congress, at Washington</i>,” or, at the option of the
person entering the copyright, the words: “<i>Copyright, 18—,
by ⸺</i>.”</p>

<p>The law imposes a penalty of $100 upon any person who
has not obtained copyright who shall insert the notice “<i>Entered
according to act of Congress</i>,” or “<i>Copyright</i>,” etc., or
words of the same import, in or upon any book or other article.</p>

<p>5. Any author may reserve the right to translate or to
dramatize his own work. In this case, notice should be given
by printing the words “<i>Right of translation reserved</i>,” or
“<i>All rights reserved</i>,” below the notice of copyright entry,
and notifying the Librarian of Congress of such reservation, to
be entered upon the record.</p>

<p>Since the phrase, <em>all rights reserved</em>, refers exclusively to
the author’s right to dramatize or to translate, it has no bearing
upon any publications except original works, and will not
be entered upon the record in other cases.</p>

<p>6. The original term of copyright runs for twenty-eight years.
<em>Within six months before</em> the end of that time, the author or
designer, or his widow or children, may secure a renewal for
the further term of fourteen years, making forty-two years in
all. Applications for renewal must be accompanied by explicit
statement of ownership, in the case of the author, or of relationship,
in the case of his heirs, and must state definitely the
date and place of entry of the original copyright. Advertisement
of renewal is to be made within two months of date of
renewal certificate, in some newspaper, for four weeks.</p>

<p>7. The time within which any work entered for copyright
may be issued from the press is not limited by any law or
regulation, but depends upon the discretion of the proprietor.
A copyright may be secured for a projected work as well as
for a completed one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>8. A copyright is assignable in law by any instrument of
writing, but such assignment must be recorded in the office
of the Librarian of Congress within sixty days from its date.
The fee for this record and certificate is one dollar, and for a
certified copy of any record of assignment one dollar.</p>

<p>9. A copy of the record (or duplicate certificate) of any
copyright entry will be furnished, under seal, at the rate of
fifty cents each.</p>

<p>10. In the case of books published in more than one volume,
or of periodicals published in numbers, or of engravings, photographs,
or other articles published with variations, a copyright
is to be entered for each volume or part of a book, or
number of a periodical, or variety, as to style, title, or inscription,
of any other article. But a book published serially in a
periodical, under the same general title, requires only one
entry. To <em>complete</em> the copyright on such a work, two copies
of each serial part, as well as of the complete work (if published
separately), must be deposited.</p>

<p>11. To secure a copyright for a painting, statue, or model
or design intended to be perfected as a work of the fine arts,
so as to prevent infringement by copying, engraving, or vending
such design, a definite description must accompany the
application for copyright, and a photograph of the same, at
least as large as “cabinet size,” should be mailed to the
Librarian of Congress within ten days from the completion of
the work or design.</p>

<p>12. Copyrights cannot be granted upon trade-marks, nor
upon mere names of companies or articles, nor upon prints or
labels intended to be used with any article of manufacture.
If protection for such names or labels is desired, application
must be made to the Patent Office, where they are registered,
at a fee of $6 for labels and $25 for trade-marks.</p>

<p>13. Citizens or residents of the United States only are
entitled to copyright.</p>

<p>14. Every applicant for a copyright should state distinctly
the full name and residence of the claimant, and whether the
right is claimed as author, designer, or proprietor. No affidavit
or formal application is required.</p>

<h2 id="THE_METRIC_SYSTEM">THE METRIC SYSTEM.</h2>

<hr class="r15" />

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">The</span> Metric System is a decimal system of measures and
weights, based on the meter as its unit, which originated
in France during the last decade of the eighteenth century,
and has since been adopted by the greater number of States
in Europe and America. In the United States its use was
authorized in 1866 by Act of Congress. The length of the
<i>meter</i> was intended to be one ten-millionth part of the distance
from the equator to either pole, measured at the level of the
sea, but it is in reality a trifle less. All other units for measuring
and weighing are derived from it, and the higher or lower
denominations of the same kind of measure are obtained by
multiplying or dividing its unit by tens, and prefixing to its
name the Greek numerals, <i>deka</i> 10, <i>hekto</i> 100, <i>kilo</i> 1000, or
<i>myria</i> 10000, for the higher denominations, and the Latin
numerals, <i>deci</i> 1/10, <i>centi</i> 1/100, or <i>milli</i> 1/1000, for the lower. The
unit of weight, called the <i>gram</i>, is theoretically the weight in
vacuo of a cubic centimeter of distilled water at the temperature
of maximum density assumed to be 4° C. or 39° 1 Fe.</p>

<p>Including the meter and gram, five units have been adopted
in the metric system, viz.:—</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>1. The Meter, the unit of length, = 3.280899 feet = 39.37079 inches.</p>

<p>2. The Are, the unit of surface, = 1 square dekameter = 119.60332 square yards.</p>

<p>3. The Liter, the unit of capacity, = 1 cubic decimeter = 0.26418635 gallon =

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The earliest testimony in favour of Koster is contained in a German volume
published at Cologne in 1499, known as the <cite>Chronicle of Cologne</cite>, which was printed
by Ulrich Zell, originally of Mayence, and a well-known follower of Gutenberg and
his system. Under the heading “Of the art of printing books, when and where, and
by whom, was invented the inexpressibly useful art of printing books,” the author
says, “Although the art, as now practised, was discovered at Mayence, nevertheless
the first idea came from Holland, and the Donati, which had been previously
printed there. Those books are therefore the origin of the art.”—See <cite>Humphreys</cite>,
ch. iii. and iv.</p>

<p>We cite further the following well-known account:—</p>

<p>“About one hundred and twenty-eight years ago, Laurens Zanssen Coster inhabited
a decent and fashionable house in the city of Haarlem, situated on the market-place,
opposite the royal palace. The name of Coster was assumed, and inherited
from his ancestors, who had long enjoyed the honourable and lucrative office of
coster or sexton to the church. This man deserves to be restored to the honour of
being the first inventor of printing, of which he has been unjustly deprived by others,
who have enjoyed the praises due to him alone. As he was walking in the wood
contiguous to the city, which was the general custom of the richer citizens and men
of leisure, in the afternoon and on holidays, he began to cut letters on the bark of
the beech; with these letters he enstamped marks upon paper in a contrary direction,
in the manner of a seal, until at length he formed a few lines for his own
amusement and for the use of the children of his brother-in-law. This succeeding
so well, he attempted greater things; and, being a man of genius and reflection, he
invented, with the aid of his brother- or son-in-law, Thomas Pietrison, a thicker and
more adhesive ink, as the common ink was too thin and made blotted marks. With
this ink he was able to print blocks and figures, to which he added letters. I have
seen specimens of his printing in this manner. In the beginning he printed on
one side only. This was a Dutch book, entitled <cite>Spiegal enser Behoudenisse</cite>. That
it was one of the first books printed after the invention of the art, appears from the
leaves, which are pasted together, that the naked sides might not be offensive to the
eyes; and none at first were printed in a more perfect manner. As this new species
of traffic attracted numerous customers, thus did the profits arising from it increase
his love for the art and his diligence in the exercise of it.</p>

<p>“He engaged workmen, which was the source of the mischief. Among these workmen
was one Jan ⸺: whether his surname be that of Faust, or any other, is of no
great importance to me, as I will not disturb the dead, whose consciences must have
smote them sufficiently while living. This Jan, who assisted at the printing press
under oath, after he had learned the art of casting the types, setting them, and
other articles belonging to the art, and thought himself sufficiently instructed, having
watched the opportunity, as he could not find a better, he packed up the types
and the other articles on Christmas eve, while the family was engaged in celebrating
the festival, and stole away with them. He first fled to Amsterdam, thence to
Cologne, until he could establish himself at Mentz, as a secure place, where he might
open shop and reap the fruits of his knavery. It is a known fact that within the
twelve months (that is, in the year 1440) he published the <cite>Alexandri Galli Doctrinale</cite>,
(a grammar at that time in high repute,) with <cite>Petri Hispani Tractatibus
Logicis</cite>, with the same letters which Laurens had used. These were undoubtedly
the first products of his press. These are the principal circumstances that I have
collected from creditable persons far advanced in years, which they have transmitted
like a flaming torch from hand to hand: I have also met with others who have
confirmed the same.”—<cite>Hadrianus Junius</cite>, 1568.</p>

name. Only a few impressions have been preserved to the present time; indeed,
they were entirely lost to the world until the latter half of the last century, when a
copy was discovered in the library of Cardinal Mazarin in Paris; hence, the few
existing copies are generally spoken of as Mazarin Bibles. Some of these were
printed on vellum, but the earliest copies were on paper. There are only six copies
now extant; two of which are in the United States, one belonging to the collection
of the late Mr. George Brinley of Connecticut, and the other owned by the late
Mr. James Lenox of New York. These two copies are on paper. The Brinley
copy is said to have a leaf or two in fac-simile, while the Lenox copy is perfect in
every respect. This copy, together with his unequalled collection of rare Bibles,
now enriches the magnificent Lenox Library, founded in New York, in 1870, by
this excellent and wisely beneficent man. The four remaining copies are in Europe,
two of which were sold in London at auction; one on vellum selling for $20,000,
and the other, on paper, bringing $14,000.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> “The names of Koster and Gutenberg will ever remain associated with its
positive invention; and to Koster, if we are to be guided by a vast mass of unanswerable
evidence in his favour, must be assigned the glory of achieving the first
actual steps in that art, of which Gutenberg was soon destined, not only to extend
and solidify the basis, but to raise at once upon that basis a most noble superstructure.”—<cite>Humphreys</cite>,
p. 50.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> For detailed and conflicting accounts, see Humphreys’s <cite>History of the Art of
Printing</cite>, (London,) and De Vinne’s <cite>Invention of Printing</cite>, (New York.)</p>

<p>Humphreys dispassionately goes over the ground, and while giving due credit to
Gutenberg, awards to Koster the honour of the invention of the art of printing. A
perusal of De Vinne, on the other hand, leaves the impression of an effort to
prove a preconceived opinion, every probability in favour of Koster being curtly
set aside, and every perchance on the side of Gutenberg being regarded as incontrovertible
fact. De Vinne derides the idea that types were at first cut, and not cast
or founded; and this in the face of the fact that in the earliest printed books, there
are not two letters of one kind that are precisely alike in a page; that is, every letter
a varies somewhat from all other a’s, and so with b and all other letters. This could
not be the case if the types were cast or founded. To support his view, De Vinne
copies from De la Borde a wood engraving representing letters cut and sawn apart;
and from the imperfection of this experiment argues that the first types could not
have been cut. This proves nothing except the incapacity of the experimenter. A
dozen years ago an ingenious man in Philadelphia produced copper-headed types
in a mass on type-metal bodies, which had to be cut apart singly. The specimen
of these types here given proves conclusively that the thing can be done far better
than was done by Koster on wood or metal, though his types were ten times larger
than these:—</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">We have repeated the experiment in our own foundry with Long Primer type, and
with a similar result. These experiments are sufficient to show the ungroundedness
of Mr. De Vinne’s argument. He further states that in some of the specimens given
by him, the letters have been so worn that they have run into one another; but the
fact is, such letters were logotypes, and cut on the same block. Any accurate type-founder
can verify this fact almost at a glance. In a lecture by Mr. Josiah Marples,
an accurate English printer, before the Liverpool Literary and Philosophical Society
on <cite>Type-founders and Type-founding</cite>, the speaker alluded to Caxton and his types,
and to Mr. Vincent Figgins’s reproduction of the “Game of Chesse,” whose nephew
had enabled him to exhibit a copy of the same to the meeting. “Mr. Vincent Figgins,
whose skill as a practical type-founder,” it was remarked, “entitled his opinion
to great weight, believed that the book was not printed from types such as were cast
by Schœffer, but from types which were cast with solid faces, upon which were cut
with the graver each letter separately. To this Mr. Figgins attributed the fact that
in the original book no pure style of letters was used, but a mixture between the old
black and that called Secretary; that no two letters were exactly alike, and that
frequent use was made of logotypes.”</p>

<p>Mr. De Vinne finds some difficulty in demolishing the Koster “legend” (as he
and Van der Linde call it) in the fact that the existence of numerous volumes and
fragments of ancient printing have to be somehow accounted for; and he thereupon
adopts the hypothesis of an unknown printer, to whom he attributes these early
productions. The admittedly ancient water-marks in the paper he rules out, simply
because such water-marks were used long afterward. He gives fac-simile specimens
of the types used in these books; but, in violation of all the laws of probability, he
gives the inferior specimens last. The necessities of his theory compelled him to this
course, the natural order being the reverse of the one adopted by him. The inferior
specimens show clearly the first attempts of an inventor, an inventor too who had
before been a block printer. The succeeding books show as clearly the successive
stages of improvement, the last stage of which was equal or even superior to
any thing executed by Gutenberg before the appearance of the great Bible. This
“unknown printer” was doubtless Koster.</p>

<p>It is by no means a wild question whether the credit of even the first Bible belongs
to Gutenberg or to Peter Schœffer; for, after the dissolution of the partnership
between Gutenberg and Fust, the former produced nothing worthy of note, while
Schœffer printed the Bible again, as well as other works, notably the Psalter, a most
wonderful specimen of ancient typography. Schœffer appears to be as undoubtedly
the inventor of type-founding as Koster was of printing,—Gutenberg was neither,
though we must award him high credit for his skill in availing himself of the knowledge
derived from Koster, and his perseverance through a series of years. But the
almost impenetrable cloud of mystery that surrounds the discovery of printing
should induce a spirit of hesitancy that is not at all characteristic of Van der Linde
and others. Neither ifs, buts, nor perhapses, nor strained inferences, prove anything
except the weakness of the argument that rests upon them.</p>

<p>We are satisfied that the types used by the first printers were not cast or founded
in a mode at all approximating to the modern method. The question is, not who
was the first type-founder in the modern style, but who was the first printer with
movable types, no matter whether of wood, pewter, or tin; and we agree with the
judicious Isaiah Thomas in the opinion that Koster was that man.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> After the retirement of Binny &amp; Ronaldson, Richard Ronaldson carried on the
business of this foundry until 1833, when he in turn was succeeded by Lawrence
Johnson and George F. Smith. Mr. Johnson, a man of great energy and enterprise,
had (contemporaneously with Jedediah Howe) introduced stereotyping into Philadelphia,
and now both callings were incorporated. Ten years afterward, Mr. Smith
retired; and in the year 1845 Mr. Johnson associated with him Thomas MacKellar,
John F. Smith and Richard Smith, who had, as it were, grown up with the business.
The foundry now quickly grew in importance, and won a wide reputation. Mr.
Johnson died April 26, 1860, and was succeeded by his three partners, who, with
Peter A. Jordan, constituted the firm known as MacKellar, Smiths &amp; Jordan, under
whose management the establishment was brought to rank equal with and excel
most of the type foundries in the world. Mr. Jordan died March 25, 1884. In 1885
Wm. B. MacKellar, G. Fredk Jordan and C. F. Huch were associated with the
remaining partners, and a corporation was formed under the name of The MacKellar,
Smiths &amp; Jordan Company. Their “Typographic Advertiser” (begun in 1855)
and Specimen Books are regarded as unique mechanical and literary productions.
The height and body of the Pica of this Company have been universally adopted in
the United States as the standard of size for the American Point System of type.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Wilson, in his <cite>Treatise on English Punctuation</cite>, says, very judiciously,—</p>

<p>The hyphen is employed in words in such a manner as is best calculated to show
their origin, composition, or import, and to exhibit the syllables in their neatest
form. Agreeably to this rule,—</p>

<p>1. Compound and derivative words are resolved into their primitives; as, <i>school-master</i>,
<i>hand-writing</i>, <i>pen-knife</i>, <i>snuff-box</i>, <i>looking-glass</i>; <i>arch-angel</i>, <i>geo-logy</i>,
<i>theo-cracy</i>, <i>ortho-graphy</i>.</p>

<p>2. Prefixes, affixes, and grammatical terminations are separated; as, <i>dis-continue</i>,
<i>en-able</i>, <i>trans-port</i>; <i>shear-er</i>, <i>load-ed</i>, <i>print-ing</i>; <i>king-dom</i>, <i>false-hood</i>,
<i>differ-ence</i>, <i>command-ment</i>.</p>

<p>3. One consonant between two vowels is to be joined to the latter syllable; as,
<i>ta-lent</i>, <i>fa-tal</i>; <i>me-lon</i>, <i>le-ver</i>; <i>spi-rit</i>, <i>si-lence</i>; <i>cy-nic</i>, <i>ty-ro</i>; <i>le-ga-cy</i>, <i>mo-no-po-ly</i>.
Except <i>x</i>, and single consonants when they belong to the former portion of
a derivative word; as, <i>ex-ile</i>, <i>ex-ist</i>, <i>ex-amine</i>; <i>up-on</i>, <i>dis-ease</i>, <i>circum-ambient</i>.</p>

<p>4. Two or more consonants belong to the latter syllable, when they are capable
of beginning a word; as, <i>ta-ble</i>, <i>sti-fle</i>, <i>lu-cre</i>, <i>o-gle</i>, <i>mau-gre</i>, <i>stro-phe</i>, <i>de-stroy</i>.</p>

<p>5. But when the consonants cannot begin a word, or when the vowel preceding
them is short, the first should be separated; as, <i>ab-bey</i>, <i>ac-cent</i>, <i>vel-lum</i>, <i>ab-ject</i>,
<i>gar-den</i>, <i>laun-dry</i>, <i>pam-phlet</i>; <i>blas-pheme</i>, <i>dis-tress</i>, <i>min-strel</i>.</p>

<p>It is desirable that compound and derivative words should, at the end of lines,
be divided in such a manner as to indicate their principal parts. Thus, <i>school-master</i>
is preferable to <i>schoolmas-ter</i>, <i>dis-approve</i> to <i>disap-prove</i>, <i>resent-ment</i>
to <i>re-sentment</i>, <i>ortho-doxy</i> to <i>or-thodoxy</i>; though, as regards the analysis of words
into syllables, the latter mode is unobjectionable. From the narrowness of the
printed line, however, in some books, the principle recommended cannot always be
adhered to.</p>

<p>The terminations <i>tion</i>, <i>sion</i>, <i>cial</i>, <i>tial</i>, and many others, formerly pronounced as
two syllables, but now only as one, must not be divided either in spelling or at the
end of a line.</p>

<p>A syllable consisting of only one letter, as the <i>a</i> in <i>cre-ation</i>, should not commence
a line. This word would be better divided <i>crea-tion</i>; and so all others of
a similar kind.</p>

<p>A line of print must not end with the first syllable of a word when it consists of
a single letter; as, <i>a-bide</i>, <i>e-normous</i>; nor begin with the last syllable when it is
formed of only two letters; as, <i>nation-al</i>, <i>teach-er</i>, <i>similar-ly</i>. For regard should
be had to the principles of taste and beauty as well as to the laws of syllabication.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_17" id="Footnote_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> We are indebted to a friend for the following sketch of the origin, progress, and
present condition of the world-famous house of R. Hoe &amp; Co.</p>

<p>Robert Hoe, the founder of the present house of R. Hoe &amp; Co. of New York,
was born at Hose, in Leicestershire, England, in 1784. His father was a well-to-do
farmer in that pleasant, sequestered district; but, as the family was large,
Robert was apprenticed to a carpenter in a neighbouring town. His attention
was early attracted and his mind impressed by the prosperity of the people of the
United States; and, being a republican at heart, and conscious that the institutions
of his own country presented almost insurmountable obstacles to the advancement
of the working classes, he purchased his indentures from his employer,
and in 1803 emigrated to New York.</p>

<p>On his arrival he made the acquaintance of Grant Thorburn, who, becoming
interested in him, received him into his family, and with great kindness nursed
him with his own hands through an attack of the yellow fever, which was then
raging in the city. He soon established himself in his trade, and, by his industry,
integrity, and enterprise, became advantageously known to the public.
At the age of twenty he married the daughter of Matthew Smith, of Westchester
Co., New York, by whom he had three sons and six daughters. For a time he
was in partnership with his brother-in-law, Matthew Smith, Jr., a carpenter and
printers’ joiner, who, on their separation, associated with himself his brother,
Peter Smith, who was educated at Yale College, and was the inventor of the well-known
hand-press bearing his name.</p>

<p>On the decease of these two brothers, Robert Hoe, in 1823, succeeded to the
business, which was then in its infancy, giving employment to only a handful of
men, and being conducted in the middle of the block bounded by Maiden Lane,
Pine, William, and Pearl Streets, in some old buildings to which access was gained
by an alley running from Maiden Lane to Pine Street. Here the business, under
the style of Robert Hoe &amp; Co., grew rapidly; but the extension of Cedar Street
made necessary its removal to the present location in Gold Street. About this
time, the flat-bed cylinder press, for newspaper printing, was introduced into England;
and Mr. Hoe sent an intelligent mechanic there to examine it, and it was
soon brought into use here, with valuable improvements. In 1832, Mr. Hoe’s
failing health obliged him to relinquish the business to his eldest son, Richard M.
Hoe, and Matthew Smith, son of his first partner. In the following year he died.
Shortly after his decease, the firm erected extensive buildings in Broome Street, in
the eastern part of the city, where the greater part of their manufacturing has
since been carried on. They also commenced making cast-steel saws, which had
previously been exclusively imported from England; and this branch has steadily
increased in importance.</p>

<p>Matthew Smith, a man of uncommon ability and business talents, died in 1842.
The business was then continued by Richard M. Hoe, with his two brothers,
Robert Hoe and Peter Smith Hoe,—the eldest, as before, taking charge of the
mechanical department, in which his industry and fertility of invention are attested
by the number and value of his patents. In 1837, he patented here and in England
his method of grinding circular saws, by which the thickness of any part of a saw
can be regulated with accuracy. In 1846, he brought out the so-called “Lightning
Press,” or Type-Revolving Printing Machine, described in the text,—the greatest
innovation on the routine of the printing craft since the days of Gutenberg. This
press entirely superseded all others for fast printing, and was introduced into the
principal offices, not only in this country, but in England, Scotland, Ireland, and
Australia.</p>

<p>In 1858, the firm purchased of Isaac Adams, of Boston, Massachusetts, his
entire patent-rights, together with his establishment for the manufacture of his
bed-and-platen book printing presses, and various machines for binders’ use, which
they continue to conduct there, though with increased facilities and many improvements.
Their works in different places now cover thirty-five city lots, or about two
acres, and give employment to nearly six hundred hands. The office and warerooms
of the house in England are at 13 Salisbury Square, Fleet Street, London,
one of the partners, being a resident in that city, attending to the business there.</p>

some village mechanics, a press for his own use. With the exception of a stone
bed, the principal parts were made entirely of wood. It was a flat-bed press, having
a series of impression cylinders connected by an endless chain, by means of which
they passed over and around the bed continually. He called it the Chain-running
Press. It was employed by Frank Leslie to print an edition of his <cite>Illustrated

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
